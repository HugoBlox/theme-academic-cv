Likewise, location and socio-economic status influence both expectations and self-perception. The current study seeks to use an innovative web technology as a means of exploring these concepts using geolocated, self-reported and –recorded narratives from students in grades 6-8. This is compared to academic performance and socio-economical demographics by school under the theoretical grounding of social cognitive career theory. Future implications for study, the use of web technologies and crowdsourcing for this area of research are included.","tags":[],"title":"Student Occupational Expectations: A Geolocative Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Straight"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1299555754,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1299555754,"objectID":"43e44069de3590343aef2527783be5ed","permalink":"/publication/cots-video-games-as-call-environments/","publishdate":"2011-03-07T20:42:34-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cots-video-games-as-call-environments/","section":"publication","summary":"Computer-Assisted Language Learning can be facilitated to a great degree using commercial off-the-shelf video games. This paper attempts to explore the nature of CALL, the pedagogic qualities of video games and how the two intersect to produce useful CALL environments. Also considered are aspects of fun, what causes second language acquisition students to respond to one form of CALL over another, and concepts of ludus, paidea and narratology. An example, Heavy Rain, is offered as a potential commercial off-the-shelf game to use in second language acquisition at the university or adult-learning level.","tags":["video games","computer-assisted language learning","CALL","gaming","conference","SITE","AACE"],"title":"Commercial Off-The-Shelf Video Games as Computer-Assisted Language Learning Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jamie Smith","Ryan Straight"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1299555386,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1299555386,"objectID":"aa82b6cfe4893ef228a64a814d92c8bc","permalink":"/publication/development-and-delivery-of-custom-mobile-apps/","publishdate":"2011-03-07T20:36:26-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/development-and-delivery-of-custom-mobile-apps/","section":"publication","summary":"The advancements in mobile devices have great affordances for the field of education. Modern smartphones are powerful, portable, and prevalent and can yield informative, engaging and empowering user experiences for students in classroom settings and beyond. This paper explores current trends and issues in the use of mobile devices for learning (mLearning) and presents a variety of viable options for developing and delivering custom content in the form of mobile applications. Relevant applications, services, and skill sets are discussed with a focus on specific capabilities. Resources are presented along a continuum of prerequisite technical skill with the intent to demonstrate to K-12 teachers the approachability of creating custom mobile applications for learning at any level of experience.","tags":["mobile learning","mobile apps","k-12","SITE","conference","AACE"],"title":"The Development and Delivery of Custom Mobile Apps for K-12 Learning: Viable Options for Educators","type":"publication"}]
