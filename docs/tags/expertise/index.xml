      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading Katie Linder&amp;rsquo;s Medium essay &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@katie__linder/when-do-you-call-yourself-an-expert-f273b17a02e9#.jpz9ksg5k&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;When Do You Call Yourself an Expert&lt;/a&gt; on the same day that listened to her &lt;a href=&#34;http://ygtpodcast.com/ep23/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Imposter Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; episode on the You&amp;rsquo;ve Got This podcast while getting ready for Faculty Forum. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s a coincidence, honestly. I mean, the timing might be but I&amp;rsquo;m clearly drawn to this topic. So, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write up my own thoughts about it and publish them on the internet because, hey, bravery comes before confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essay reminded me of what I feel like was my first out there moment in which I was also interviewed for a podcast. Hers was for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://teachinginhighered.com/episodes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Teaching in Higher Ed podcast&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bonni208&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bonnie Stachowiak&lt;/a&gt;, while mine was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://immersivelrn.org/resources/the-versatilist-podcast/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Versatilist podcast&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by the wonderfully welcoming Patrick O&amp;rsquo;Shea. Like Katie, I can safely say the experience was enjoyable, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with it, and I&amp;rsquo;m not unhappy with the result. To be fair, I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually even listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/versatilist/episodes/2015-10-26T10_27_09-07_00&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my Versatilist podcast episode&lt;/a&gt; as I a) can&amp;rsquo;t abide the sound of my own voice (an unfortunate state of affairs considering I teach fully online and record myself teaching upwards of 4 times a week), and b) well, precisely what I&amp;rsquo;m getting into with this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I did the Versatilist I had just begun my teaching and had only just recently graduated with my Ph.D, though I was already full-time faculty and was taking over as Program Director while the former PD was on sabbatical. Needless to say, I was a bit out of my depth and unprepared, considering I got so few chances to teach while in graduate school as I was working full time as a trainer for the University&amp;rsquo;s IT department. Regardless, when I was asked to be on the podcast I thought, &amp;lsquo;Sure, why not?&amp;rsquo; Again, bravery before confidence, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did the podcast and I think it went fine. I enjoyed the 45-ish minutes and never really felt like I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I was talking about, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t (and to a certain extent still don&amp;rsquo;t) feel like an &lt;em&gt;expert&lt;/em&gt; in any particular field. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I&amp;rsquo;m not working on it but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable wearing the badge just quite yet. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I was a good fit for the Versatilist: Jack of all trades and master of none? Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pixabay.com/en/mike-sound-system-podcast-1737612/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mic.png&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; alt=&#34;By Mindthaw via Pixabay.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
One scary thing for me was the idea that there would now be a record of me rambling on about this and that, from my doctoral research to my experience teaching as new faculty, but that anyone could access it at any time and &lt;em&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be there to respond&lt;/em&gt;. If I tweet something or say something in class there&amp;rsquo;s an avenue for discussion, for dialog, be it synchronous or asynchronous. Being a guest on a podcast is, obviously, being interviewed and having that interview published: it&amp;rsquo;s out there and that sole fact invites scrutiny. (Going on another this week, coincidentally.) So maybe it&amp;rsquo;s more a fear of making a mistake and being caught out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one point I wanted to make in the podcast (and why we&amp;rsquo;ve taken this winding path) was that I think I&amp;rsquo;ve always been hungry for something different. I&amp;rsquo;m a neophile, a fan of novelty with a great love of the new-and-improved. That is to say, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for more&amp;hellip; more information, more methods, more theories, more examples, more tools. More, more, more. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that if I ever find myself settling comfortably into the &lt;em&gt;expert&lt;/em&gt; chair then that part of me could disappear, as if expertise were a destination and not a journey (to get all cat-hanging-from-a-ledge-motivational-poster for a minute). I don&amp;rsquo;t want that to happen. Satisfaction is having one foot in the grave or some such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it would help new graduates or junior faculty to see that others at the same career point are also in the same boat, confidence- or bravery-wise. It&amp;rsquo;s a long road and not one that has any particular sign posts or even a decent map. We have to make our own ways, sometimes even cut our own paths&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Did-you-know-you&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Did-you-know-you&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Maybe we get lucky enough to find a mentor that has an idea about the ditches and bumps, but that&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee. Navigating all this is part of the process and, frankly, I think it&amp;rsquo;s good for us. Maybe not &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;; maybe &lt;strong&gt;necessary&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, for now I think I&amp;rsquo;m most comfortable claiming that I&amp;rsquo;m on a constant path toward expertise. Maybe when I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve finally claimed the prize I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know. Maybe, when I&amp;rsquo;m like Katie and have two-almost-three books under my belt, I&amp;rsquo;ll claim it. Until then, hi-ho, hi-ho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:Did-you-know-you&#34;&gt;Did you know you can buy machetes at Home Depot? They&amp;rsquo;re with the gardening tools. That blew my mind. Not sure where I thought they were sold before I discovered this. Not sure I&amp;rsquo;d ever thought about where they&amp;rsquo;re sold before then. It just struck me as odd. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:Did-you-know-you&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
