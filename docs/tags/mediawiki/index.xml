      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say I&amp;rsquo;m the &lt;em&gt;typical&lt;/em&gt; professor (heck, I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenewprofessor.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an entire podcast devoted to exploring just what the heck that means&lt;/a&gt;) but I certainly do occasionally resemble the clich√©d &lt;em&gt;absent-minded professor&lt;/em&gt;. Remember: good thoughts are clear thoughts and that&amp;rsquo;s much harder than it sounds when your job is to think about so much, so often, for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, we have a lot of stuff in our heads. In my experience, one of the most difficult and daunting aspects of working in a primarily intellectual field is nothing more than the organization of thoughts and ideas. We&amp;rsquo;re confronted with new ideas, questions, corrections, updates, improvements, alterations, and retractions nearly every day as we learn more and more about virtually everything. So the question becomes: if we&amp;rsquo;re not superhuman, how do we keep track?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could make it your priority to spend the entirety of your time and energy on memorizing the minutiae of everything but, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, we&amp;rsquo;re not all cut out for that kind of perfect recall. I, for one, need to keep notes or I just &lt;em&gt;forget&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re the same. But then the question becomes: where do you keep them? How do you organize them? How much do you automate and how much do you update? Whether it&amp;rsquo;s your reading notes on one particular scholar&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;ouvre&lt;/em&gt; or a little reminder to add a particular resource to an assignment for a class, we (normally) can&amp;rsquo;t just keep all that in our heads. I know some people, like the prolific Raul Pacheco-Vega, that use physical bucket-style collections (in his case, the &amp;ldquo;Everything Notebook&amp;rdquo;). Others create hundreds or thousands of Google Documents or giant Scrivener projects. The important part is that it works &lt;em&gt;for them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a very, very long time to figure out a system that a) is sustainable, b) I&amp;rsquo;ll actually use, and c) is designed in a way that mirrors (or at least generally reflects) the way my thought processes work. I tried virtually every organizational paradigm out there, from the Evernote-style bucket to physical notebooks (and, I have to say, I&amp;rsquo;m devastated that physical notebooks don&amp;rsquo;t do it for me because I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; them and own many, many blank ones). What I discovered is, beyond all that, that I love creating systems. What I love less than that is &lt;em&gt;maintaining&lt;/em&gt; them. So, my job became to find a system that I felt like I was creating &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;, something malleable, something always growing and improving, and something within which I could automate the more mundane tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenewprofessor.com/019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;episode 19 of The New Professor&lt;/a&gt;, you already know what I&amp;rsquo;m going to say next: for me, even though it may sound like a lot of work, the best environment to off-load information and ideas is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Semantic MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to know exactly how I do that or what it looks like&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait on another post. (I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping the wiki for nearly a decade and created a three-part series on how to set one up back in, probably, 2009 but that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; gone.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So watch for those posts. Hopefully they can be of help to you. (Whenever they get here.)&lt;/p&gt;
