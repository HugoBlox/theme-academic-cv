&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start placing the &lt;em&gt;Read&lt;/em&gt; portion of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ryanstraight.com/project/read-watch-woof/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read, Watch, Woof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; newsletters in the blog. So, while you can get the writing part of it, you&amp;rsquo;ll miss the dogs and the video if you&amp;rsquo;re not signed up. Jus&amp;rsquo; sayin&amp;rsquo;. So here&amp;rsquo;s a piece about evidence and being willing to change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the first week of fall semester and there is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; going on, as you can imagine. I know some of you dear readers are in the same academic boat as I am, so know that &lt;em&gt;you are seen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about &lt;strong&gt;evidence&lt;/strong&gt;. Not evidence in the Forensic Files sense (side note: have you noticed that a television channel called &lt;em&gt;Escape&lt;/em&gt; shows almost 24-7 &amp;ldquo;true crime&amp;rdquo; shows? what on earth does that say about us?) but in the how-we-make-the-best-decisions-in-an-attempt-to-live-our-best-lives sense. In this case, it&amp;rsquo;s actually about living our &lt;em&gt;longest&lt;/em&gt; lives. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain. (And add a caveat that I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an expert in nutrition; just somebody who really likes bacon but also really likes bread dipped in olive oil, which explains my weakness for Carbonara.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-s-talk-about-carbohydrates&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about carbohydrates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago-ish, I wrote a bit about going &amp;ldquo;low-carb.&amp;rdquo; Since then, a study was released that is the largest of its sort ever published. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect by any means (no study ever is and if anyone claims otherwise they&amp;rsquo;re trying to sell you something) but the results seem to support (pro-tip when talking about research: be wary of using absolutes like &amp;ldquo;confirm&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo;) the notion of All Things in Moderation. Turns out, according to the study, that going low-carb can actually shave years off your life. Turns out, the best diet is one that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;balanced&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;spread out&lt;/em&gt;, meaning doesn&amp;rsquo;t eschew one macronutrient entirely for another and actively seeks out variety. They say the ideal percentage of carbohydrates is about 50-55%. Should probably aim for the same protein-to-lean-mass ratio as usual, and then supplement with fat to reach your caloric goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the &amp;ldquo;Eat food, not too much, mostly plants&amp;rdquo; adage isn&amp;rsquo;t far off. Does that mean everybody needs to go vegan? Of course not. But it really does suggest something closer to the Mediterranean diet is pretty ideal. At least now I have an excuse to buy that insanely expensive bottle of olive oil!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while I stand by my assertion that you should do what works for you, specifically, in concert with advice from your physician, this is simply more information that you can use to make an informed decision (along with your doctor).  See? Evidence. That&amp;rsquo;s the nature of being a skeptic and trusting in the scientific method: when new evidence that is gathered genuinely and presented with fidelity and neutrality goes against previous evidence (or, in many cases, assumptions), it&amp;rsquo;s important to incorporate that into your decision making without prejudice or embarrassment. Evidenced-based &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; is more likely to be beneficial than choices made based on whims or spurious assertions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth-and-i-m-not-just-talking-about-my-waistline-stupid-carbs&#34;&gt;Growth, and I&amp;rsquo;m not just talking about my waistline (&amp;hellip;stupid carbs)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to evidence more broadly. I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in evidence-based policies, decisions, anything, really. Having said that, it is in our nature to conflate and incorporate our ideas, likes, and decisions (regardless of their premises) with our senses of &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;. Ever gotten in an argument with someone about a band that they think is just &lt;em&gt;a-ma-zing&lt;/em&gt; and you simply don&amp;rsquo;t see it? And they take it personally? Your dislike of their favorite thing is converted into a dislike of &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. This is something I&amp;rsquo;m certain we&amp;rsquo;ve all experienced on both sides. (I will argue all night about whether &lt;em&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/em&gt; is the most perfect album of all time. Spoiler: it absolutely is.) This kind of internalization can be hugely damaging to both a healthy sense of identity and rational public discourse. I&amp;rsquo;ll simply point you toward any Facebook comment thread that devolves into a shouting match and personal insults because of something even remotely resembling a political stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to overcome this. We need to be better at separating our opinions from our identities. We need to learn again how to grow, admit past mistakes, and see an update to our thinking upon the presentation of new evidence as a &lt;em&gt;virtue&lt;/em&gt; rather than an admittance of fault. We are works-in-progress and should be thrilled when we get to make that progress, regardless of how it happens. In a video game, if you improve your character based on something you learn in-game or a mechanic you start understanding better, do you project embarrassment onto the character because they hadn&amp;rsquo;t been doing that all along? Would it even make sense to reject that new knowledge simply because it conflicts with an existing view? No. That would be lunacy. A self-imposed handicap, hamstringing yourself for the sake of pride. So why would we do that in reality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it much more human to update your convictions and expand your thinking on a topic when presented with new information than to dig your heels in and resist simply because it means disagreeing with your past self. In politics, a change in position is often referred to as flip-flopping, but this is entirely different. If your position is that penguins live solely in the Great Lakes region of North America and, upon being presented with evidence that no, in fact, they&amp;rsquo;re from the southern hemisphere and do not actually spend any time with polar bears, you change your position about penguin habitat locations&amp;hellip; that is not flip-flopping. That&amp;rsquo;s correcting a faulty assumption. We need more of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence gathered genuinely and presented without ulterior motive should not be seen as a threat or a personal attack on someone that held contradictory views. It should be accepted, reviewed, scrutinized, and incorporated in an existing body of evidence and used to make better, more informed decisions about our lives and the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;rsquo;s a long way of saying I&amp;rsquo;m eating bread again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Not that Kind of Hot Dog</title>
      <link>https://ryanstraight.com/2018/07/24/not-that-kind-of-hot-dog/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hot outside in Arizona. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s hot virtually everywhere, to be fair. We&amp;rsquo;re at the very beginning of an extreme heat advisory that lasts from yesterday (July 23, 2018) morning all the way through Wednesday night. It&amp;rsquo;s dangerously hot.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Keep in mind it&amp;rsquo;s actually hotter &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; than it was yesterday. Today it&amp;rsquo;s a high of 112F (44.4C). The images you&amp;rsquo;ll find below were taken on a day with a high of 109F (42.7C).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you know about our dogs and how much we love them. (Read: spoil.) Considering the excessive heat warning, I began wondering just how hot the back yard gets during the day. I know the general numbers but what about in our actual back yard where our actual dogs actually walk around, actually?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to demonstrate what I talked about back in my Thermoception episode of The New Professor&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: the difference between ambient air temperature and the temperature of the pavement. This is especially important for animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently having procured an infrared thermometer to use when cooking, it occurred to me I could use it to really illustrate these dangers. These are taken in the same spots throughout the day. You&amp;rsquo;ll see when and how the shade from the house alters the temperature. Please, think about this when you want to take your dogs out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s not a perfect analog, consider these water temperatures and time required for &amp;ldquo;deep burn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;figure/steak.html&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below each picture and accompanying temperature is a description of a relative internal cooking temperature&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-30pm&#34;&gt;7:30pm&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Educated vs Intelligent</title>
      <link>https://ryanstraight.com/2018/07/06/educated-vs-intelligent/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nell,&amp;rdquo; the Constable continued, indicating through his tone of voice that the lesson was concluding, &amp;ldquo;the difference between ignorant and educated people is that the latter know more facts. But that has nothing to do with whether they are stupid or intelligent. The difference between stupid and intelligent people — and this is true whether or not they are well-educated — is that intelligent people can handle subtlety. They are not baffled by ambiguous or even contradictory situations — in fact, they expect them and are apt to become suspicious when things seem overly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In your Primer you have a resource that will make you highly educated, but it will never make you intelligent. That comes from life. Your life up to this point has given you all of the experience you need to be intelligent but you have to think about those experiences. If you don&amp;rsquo;t think about them, you&amp;rsquo;ll be psychologically unwell. If you do think about them, you will become not merely educated but intelligent&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>On Expertise and Being &#39;Out There&#39;</title>
      <link>https://ryanstraight.com/2017/03/01/on-expertise-and-being-out-there/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ryanstraight.com/2017/03/01/on-expertise-and-being-out-there/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading Katie Linder&amp;rsquo;s Medium essay &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@katie__linder/when-do-you-call-yourself-an-expert-f273b17a02e9#.jpz9ksg5k&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;When Do You Call Yourself an Expert&lt;/a&gt; on the same day that listened to her &lt;a href=&#34;http://ygtpodcast.com/ep23/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Imposter Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; episode on the You&amp;rsquo;ve Got This podcast while getting ready for Faculty Forum. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s a coincidence, honestly. I mean, the timing might be but I&amp;rsquo;m clearly drawn to this topic. So, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write up my own thoughts about it and publish them on the internet because, hey, bravery comes before confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essay reminded me of what I feel like was my first out there moment in which I was also interviewed for a podcast. Hers was for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://teachinginhighered.com/episodes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Teaching in Higher Ed podcast&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bonni208&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bonnie Stachowiak&lt;/a&gt;, while mine was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://immersivelrn.org/resources/the-versatilist-podcast/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Versatilist podcast&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by the wonderfully welcoming Patrick O&amp;rsquo;Shea. Like Katie, I can safely say the experience was enjoyable, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with it, and I&amp;rsquo;m not unhappy with the result. To be fair, I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually even listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/versatilist/episodes/2015-10-26T10_27_09-07_00&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my Versatilist podcast episode&lt;/a&gt; as I a) can&amp;rsquo;t abide the sound of my own voice (an unfortunate state of affairs considering I teach fully online and record myself teaching upwards of 4 times a week), and b) well, precisely what I&amp;rsquo;m getting into with this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I did the Versatilist I had just begun my teaching and had only just recently graduated with my Ph.D, though I was already full-time faculty and was taking over as Program Director while the former PD was on sabbatical. Needless to say, I was a bit out of my depth and unprepared, considering I got so few chances to teach while in graduate school as I was working full time as a trainer for the University&amp;rsquo;s IT department. Regardless, when I was asked to be on the podcast I thought, &amp;lsquo;Sure, why not?&amp;rsquo; Again, bravery before confidence, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did the podcast and I think it went fine. I enjoyed the 45-ish minutes and never really felt like I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I was talking about, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t (and to a certain extent still don&amp;rsquo;t) feel like an &lt;em&gt;expert&lt;/em&gt; in any particular field. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I&amp;rsquo;m not working on it but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable wearing the badge just quite yet. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I was a good fit for the Versatilist: Jack of all trades and master of none? Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pixabay.com/en/mike-sound-system-podcast-1737612/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mic.png&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; alt=&#34;By Mindthaw via Pixabay.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
One scary thing for me was the idea that there would now be a record of me rambling on about this and that, from my doctoral research to my experience teaching as new faculty, but that anyone could access it at any time and &lt;em&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be there to respond&lt;/em&gt;. If I tweet something or say something in class there&amp;rsquo;s an avenue for discussion, for dialog, be it synchronous or asynchronous. Being a guest on a podcast is, obviously, being interviewed and having that interview published: it&amp;rsquo;s out there and that sole fact invites scrutiny. (Going on another this week, coincidentally.) So maybe it&amp;rsquo;s more a fear of making a mistake and being caught out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one point I wanted to make in the podcast (and why we&amp;rsquo;ve taken this winding path) was that I think I&amp;rsquo;ve always been hungry for something different. I&amp;rsquo;m a neophile, a fan of novelty with a great love of the new-and-improved. That is to say, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for more&amp;hellip; more information, more methods, more theories, more examples, more tools. More, more, more. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that if I ever find myself settling comfortably into the &lt;em&gt;expert&lt;/em&gt; chair then that part of me could disappear, as if expertise were a destination and not a journey (to get all cat-hanging-from-a-ledge-motivational-poster for a minute). I don&amp;rsquo;t want that to happen. Satisfaction is having one foot in the grave or some such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it would help new graduates or junior faculty to see that others at the same career point are also in the same boat, confidence- or bravery-wise. It&amp;rsquo;s a long road and not one that has any particular sign posts or even a decent map. We have to make our own ways, sometimes even cut our own paths&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Did-you-know-you&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Did-you-know-you&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Maybe we get lucky enough to find a mentor that has an idea about the ditches and bumps, but that&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee. Navigating all this is part of the process and, frankly, I think it&amp;rsquo;s good for us. Maybe not &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;; maybe &lt;strong&gt;necessary&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, for now I think I&amp;rsquo;m most comfortable claiming that I&amp;rsquo;m on a constant path toward expertise. Maybe when I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve finally claimed the prize I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know. Maybe, when I&amp;rsquo;m like Katie and have two-almost-three books under my belt, I&amp;rsquo;ll claim it. Until then, hi-ho, hi-ho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:Did-you-know-you&#34;&gt;Did you know you can buy machetes at Home Depot? They&amp;rsquo;re with the gardening tools. That blew my mind. Not sure where I thought they were sold before I discovered this. Not sure I&amp;rsquo;d ever thought about where they&amp;rsquo;re sold before then. It just struck me as odd. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:Did-you-know-you&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>On the Loss of a Loved One</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is in reaction to yesterday’s passing of my beloved aunt Geraldine after a half-year long battle with (what started out as) gall bladder cancer. She is very much missed and, though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be there, I believe was very well taken care of when her time came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I decided to write something on the loss of a loved one—both as a way of informing others of the passing of my aunt and as a way to cope with the loss, myself—I imagined it would flow easily and naturally from my fingers given what happened yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;PD_0001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Family&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought, &amp;lsquo;Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take much to produce something touching, heartfelt, poignant, and maybe a little tear-jerky. Just say how you feel.&amp;rsquo; And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem. It ain’t happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel anything. I feel a great many things: sadness, disappointment, anger, confusion, you name it. When my father passed in 2002 it was like a punch to the gut. I was as speechless as his passing was sudden. When my grandparents (any one of them) died, it was easier as they were elderly and ‘that’s what elderly people do.’ This time around&amp;mdash;though Jerre was in her 80s and, I suppose, in the ‘elderly’ category&amp;mdash;after hearing a six-months-to-live prognosis given six months ago to someone who was seemingly in good health, the passing of a loved one takes on a completely different color. It becomes something that weaves itself into your calendar, that you prepare for, that you make phone calls about. It’s the first time I’ve ever thought to myself, ‘I need to make sure my phone’s charged because someone is going to die.’ Not &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time it seems perfectly rational. Upon reflection it feels oddly cold. This is nobody and nothing’s fault; just something I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;PD_0045.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jerre and me&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite memories of my childhood center around Jerre and her home, which the family simply refers to as The Farm. At one point it was a functioning farm where they had pigs and chickens, and rows upon rows of vegetables. I can still smell the damp stone of the cellar where the walls were lined with cans of every foodstuff imaginable. The kitchen always smelled like frying meat of some sort and in the winter the wood burner would impregnate the entire house with the smell of a campfire. Jerre would insist you eat something (even if you weren’t hungry) and always put others’ needs before her own. I’d ride my four-wheeler or dirt bike all over The Farm and she’d rule over the place like a queen. It’s just how things were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;PD_0049.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;She was incredibly joyful.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my father passed unexpectedly, it left me and my mother alone, as my siblings (a half-brother and half-sister) are considerably older than me and were never in the ‘family unit,’ as it were. I was away at college about 90 minutes away from my family home and 60 minutes away from The Farm. Jerre’s role in my life changed slowly from being an aunt to being close to a surrogate parent, stepping in to help fill the void left by my father. She supported not just me, but my mother, as well. Our family is by-and-large pretty good at coping with loss and being alone, but it was comforting to not have to do that. Jerre, who had no children of her own and was unmarried, was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years went on, we grew closer. She got older and had trouble doing things around the house, so I (not as often as I’d liked to have, much to my regret) tried to make it over to The Farm when I could to do odd jobs, run wiring, pick up sticks in the yard, whatever she needed. The idea of her no longer being there never really crossed my mind. Jerre and The Farm were a permanent fixture in my life and there was no reason to even question that. Even after her cancer diagnosis, even during her chemotherapy, her being gone wasn’t something that seemed real or even possible. At least, not real enough to spend any energy on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That probably falls under the category of ‘denial,’ but, I’m not a psychiatrist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;PD_0183.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;We miss you.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, as the end grew closer, she was in good spirits. She laughed and still bossed people around. She was even still making sure others’ needs were taken care of when she was lying on her death-bed. Then, at about 10pm on April 14th, she left us. For the week leading up she’d been surrounded by friends and family&amp;mdash;sometimes to the point that they needed to bring in more chairs. At the end, she was there with her sister and best friend, my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Pre-1964-127.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope she was happy. Our memories of her make us exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Jerre and the millions of other people who are currently fighting, have beaten, or have lost to cancer, please consider &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.charitywatch.org/top-rated-charities&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;donating to any number of cancer charities&lt;/a&gt; or, at the very least, using &lt;a href=&#34;http://smile.amazon.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon Smile&lt;/a&gt; whenever you buy goods online and choose from their extensive list of charities. Every bit helps.&lt;/p&gt;
