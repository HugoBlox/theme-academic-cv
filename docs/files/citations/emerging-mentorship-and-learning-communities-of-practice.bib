	abstract = { As augmented reality gaming becomes increasingly popular, understanding the organically emergent communities of learning that emerge within the player base becomes increasingly useful for anyone seeking to leverage these experiences for informal and formal educational means. This paper seeks to examine the phenomenon, situate augmented reality gaming in the greater video game sphere, and elaborate on players’ experiences and stories. }
