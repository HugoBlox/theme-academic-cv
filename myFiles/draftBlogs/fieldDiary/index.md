*Fieldtrip 1: Narooma, NSW, Spring 2018; Day 16*

"I began spearing within 5 minutes of being under the water. I got rapidly acquainted with my surroundings, and pursued my targets. Each target was a select body size and, carefully chosen to fill gaps in our knowledge of underwater life. Some species are surprisingly common for us to know so little about. I aimed with careful accuracy. There were pages of university ethics, government permits, risk-assessments, scientific justification, and my own personal integrity hovering behind each sacrifice. Fish flickered and flashed in and out of shadows in front of me. Every reload of the gun cost me time, air and strength, and every mis-shot felt like a data point lost. The pressure of knowing that this was my last opportunity to collect data in this area was intense. I was so stressed that the relatively straight-forward (though not entirely simple) process of re-setting the trigger became complicated. If the stress helped at all, it gave me strength to repeated wrench back the thick rubber band to load the gun. For the first time this trip, I was able to pull the band back to the second loading point [something I would later on come to do without conscious effort]. 
What the stress did not help do, was pick targets. I wanted to both meet minimum replication and collect new species. Sometimes a fish that would boost my replication would be directly in front of me, whilst one which would add to my species list would appear in the background. It was hard to choose which to pursue; and under water both my mental and physical abilities were slowed down compared to the highly evolved wildlife around me. I can understand not just the confusion predator must feel when singling out a fish from a school, but also the confusion of having so many different schools and species to choose from.

Many of them did not see me as a predator. No predator of my size would bother hunt them or something of their size, yet here there I lurked, a foreign risk. A risk they weren’t prepared for.

A fish which distracted me from all others was the only Moorish Idol I had seen on any of these dives, despite covering largely the same area. It was small and meandering. As a tropical vagrant it was an anomaly, a valuable datapoint, an answer and a link. I tracked it for far longer than I have tracked any other fish. Many times I could have taken the shot, and many times I hesitated. I can't reload on the run. It’s a time-consuming process. First, I retrieve the spear (which often gets hooked on the reef). I feed the spear through the front guide of the gun and down along the shaft. It clicks satisfyingly into place. In the past I’ve been tricked, thinking the spear has clicked, only for it to fall out and force me to repeat the first steps. Next, I feed the monofilament down along the shaft, through the front of the gun, wrap it carefully, pull the line back taut, looping it up and over the trigger. That is only setting the trigger. Next I need to muster the strength to grab the thick rubber band at the front of the gun and using my other hand, push the metre long shaft forwards to half stretch the rubber towards me. I bring the butt of the gun to the middle of my chest, without losing the tension on the half taught rubber. From here I hunch forwards and with both hands I pull the rubber back with all my might, to the first, or preferably second, notches. Here the rubber hooks in, waiting for the trigger to release the spear, and the tension to whip the spear forwards and through the guide and out into the blue. My chest is bruised where the gun is set. By the time I, a far from expert, have done all this, any missed shot means my target has left the picture. 

So I could have shot at the Moorish Idol many times, but I didn’t. I stalked it, and I waited. Finally, it paused and I felt certain I could strike. My timing was perfect."
