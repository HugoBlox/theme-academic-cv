title: 'Informing models with data: stories from sampling the Southern Ocean'
---

Multi-species models require some information about species ecology. For example, the interaction between predator and prey species in Mizer models depends on a predator’s “preference” of specific prey, as well as the spatial overlap between the two species. But where do we get this information from? 

In most cases, data is readily available online in extensive databases such as FishBase, but, this ultimately comes from fieldwork measurements and observations. For remote environments such as the Southern Ocean, obtaining species-level data for the whole ecosystem can be costly and difficult. When working with numbers on computers, it is sometimes easy to forget their origin: and all the extensive processes, crazy weather and fun involved. 

Earlier this year, we were lucky enough to participate in a research voyage that went deep into the Southern Ocean to quantify carbon export potential (the “SOLACE” voyage, led by Professor Phillip Boyd) on the RV Investigator. Our job? To sample micronekton: free-swimming pelagic animals around 2-20cm in size. Here is a little introduction (or perhaps a reminder for those who have been) about what data collection involves out in the middle of the ocean.


 *Four steps to sampling ecosystems: an example from the SOLACE voyage*

**Step 1: Collect the samples using a trawl net**

In order to sample ecosystems in the Southern Ocean, a common method for collection
is the Rectangular Midwater Trawl (RMT) net. This net is remotely operated by the crew members on board (they won’t let us operate the big machinery!) and is programmed to open and close at predetermined depths. In this case, the depths we were looking at were 0-200m, 200-400m and 400-1000m.

**Step 2: Retrieve the sample**

After the net is retrieved and brought back on board the boat. The sample is filtered down into the cod end at the bottom of the net. The cod end is then retrieved in a bucket and transported to the lab.

**Step 3: Sort, weigh, measure, identify and record!**

In the lab, the sample is sorted into different taxonomic groups and each individual is weighed, measured and if possible, identified down to species level. Depending on the size of the sample (and the waves!), this process could take up to 8 hours. The sorted samples are then usually either frozen at -20degrees or preserved in formalin or ethanol for further research or identification.

**Step 4: From sheet to database**

After the initial sample collection process, the data exists on handwritten sheets. These sheets are then usually entered manually into online public databases or spreadsheets for further data analysis. 

Eventually, data is made publicly accessible, informing projects such as the size-based models for Southern Ocean ecosystems that we are developing for our Master’s projects!


Inessa is looking at size distributions of zooplankton in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Inessa is using the ZooScan integrated system to model the size spectrum of zooplankton communities along gradients of temperature and primary productivity. 

Annabelle is developing a multi-species size spectrum model for the fish community in the Southern Kerguelen Plateau/Prydz Bay region. Annabelle is hoping to use the model to explore the impacts of changing net primary production on the structure of the whole food web.
