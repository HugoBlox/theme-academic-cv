              research data to date has emphasized industrialized populations.
              Here, we performed large-scale shotgun metagenomic sequencing on
              1,889 individuals from rural Honduras, providing the most
              comprehensive microbiome dataset from Central America. We identify
              a distinct microbial composition enriched inPrevotellaspecies,
              with 861 previously unreported bacterial species. Functional
              profiling reveals unique carbohydrate metabolism adaptations
              consistent with high-fiber diets. Longitudinal analysis over two
              years reveals microbiome instability, with shifts in taxonomic
              diversity and metabolic potential, including changes associated
              with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we characterize the gut
              virome and eukaryotic microbiome, identifying novel viral taxa,
              includingCrassviralesphages, and a high prevalence
              ofBlastocystisspecies in individuals with greater microbial

              genetic variation on microbial composition. People who are more

               primarily manifesting as skin redness and inflammation.
               Balneotherapy proved to be a successful non-pharmacological
               option to reduce the skin areas affected by the disease, but the
               specific mechanisms underlying this effect have not been
               elucidated yet. Here we test the hypothesis that the effect of
               thermal treatments on psoriatic lesions could be partially
               mediated by changes in the resident microbial population, i.e.,
               the microbiome. METHODS: In this study, we enrolled patients with
               psoriasis and monitored changes in their skin and gut microbiome
               after a 12-bath balneotherapy course with a combination of 16S
               rRNA amplicon sequencing and metagenomics. Changes in the
               resident microbiome were then correlated with thermal therapy
               outcomes evaluated as changes in Psoriasis Area and Severity
               Index (PASI) and Body Surface Area index (BSA). RESULTS: The
               amplicon sequencing analysis of the skin microbiome showed that
               after thermal treatment the microbiome composition of affected
               areas improved to approach that typical of unaffected skin. We
               moreover identified some low-abundance bacterial biomarkers
               indicative of disease status and treatment efficacy, and we
               showed via metagenomic sequencing that thermal treatments and
               thermal water drinking affect the fecal microbiome to host more
               species associated with favorable metabolic health. CONCLUSIONS:
               Changes in lower-abundance microbial taxa presence and abundance
               could be the basis for the positive effect of thermal water
               treatment and drinking on the cutaneous and systemic
               symptomatology of psoriasis.",

               the gut microbiome plays a fundamental role in cancer immunity
               and in determining the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. In this
               work, we have investigated whether and to what extent the gut
               microbiome can influence the antitumor activity of
               neo-epitope-based cancer vaccines in a BALB/c-CT26 cancer mouse
               model. Similarly to that observed in the C57BL/6-B16 model,
               Bifidobacterium administration per se has a beneficial effect on
               CT26 tumor inhibition. Furthermore, the combination of
               Bifidobacterium administration and vaccination resulted in a
               protection which was superior to vaccination alone and to
               Bifidobacterium administration alone, and correlated with an
               increase in the frequency of vaccine-specific T cells. The gut
               microbiome analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun
               metagenomics showed that tumor challenge rapidly altered the
               microbiome population, with Muribaculaceae being enriched and
               Lachnospiraceae being reduced. Over time, the population of
               Muribaculaceae progressively reduced while the Lachnospiraceae
               population increased—a trend that appeared to be retarded by the
               oral administration of Bifidobacterium. Interestingly, in some
               Bacteroidales, Prevotella and Muribaculacee species we identified
               sequences highly homologous to immunogenic neo-epitopes of CT26
               cells, supporting the possible role of “molecular mimicry” in
               anticancer immunity. Our data strengthen the importance of the
               microbiome in cancer immunity and suggests a microbiome-based
               strategy to potentiate neo-epitope-based cancer vaccines.",

              employed to study the viral fraction of the community that is
              recalcitrant to cultivation, metagenomics can shed light into the
              diversity of viruses and their role in natural ecosystems.
              However, despite the increasing interest in virome metagenomics,
              methodological issues still hinder the proper interpretation and
              comparison of results across studies. Virome enrichment
              experimental protocols are key multi-step processes needed for
              separating and concentrating the viral fraction from the whole
              microbial community prior to sequencing. However, there is little
              information on their efficiency and their potential biases. To
              fill this gap, we used metagenomic and amplicon sequencing to
              examine the microbial community composition through the serial
              filtration and concentration steps commonly used to produce
              viral-enriched metagenomes. The analyses were performed on water
              and sediment samples from an Alpine lake. We found that, although
              the diversity of the retained microbial communities declined
              progressively during the serial filtration, the final viral
              fraction contained a large proportion (from 10\% to 40\%) of
              non-viral taxa, and that the efficacy of filtration showed biases
              based on taxonomy. Our results quantified the amount of bacterial
              genetic material in viromes and highlighted the influence of
              sample type on the enrichment efficacy. Moreover, since
              viral-enriched samples contained a significant portion of
              microbial taxa, computational sequence analysis should account for
              such biases in the downstream interpretation

              viral particles in environmental samples. However, there is little
              information on its efficiency and potential biases on the final
              result. Using a sequence-based analysis on water and sediment
              samples, we found that filtration efficacy is dependent on sample
              type and that the final virome contained a large proportion of
              non-viral taxa. Our finding stressed the importance of downstream

              non-human primate (NHP) microbiomes offers a promising approach to
              study this symbiosis. Very few microbial species have been
              characterized in NHP microbiomes due to their poor representation
              in the available cataloged microbial diversity, thus limiting the
              potential of such comparative approaches. RESULTS: We reconstruct
              over 1000 previously uncharacterized microbial species from 6
              available NHP metagenomic cohorts, resulting in an increase of the
              mappable fraction of metagenomic reads by 600\%. These novel
              species highlight that almost 90\% of the microbial diversity
              associated with NHPs has been overlooked. Comparative analysis of
              this new catalog of taxa with the collection of over 150,000
              genomes from human metagenomes points at a limited species-level
              overlap, with only 20\% of microbial candidate species in NHPs
              also found in the human microbiome. This overlap occurs mainly
              between NHPs and non-Westernized human populations and NHPs living
              in captivity, suggesting that host lifestyle plays a role
              comparable to host speciation in shaping the primate intestinal
              microbiome. Several NHP-specific species are phylogenetically
              related to human-associated microbes, such as Elusimicrobia and
              Treponema, and could be the consequence of host-dependent
              evolutionary trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: The newly reconstructed
              species greatly expand the microbial diversity associated with
              NHPs, thus enabling better interrogation of the primate microbiome
              and empowering in-depth human and non-human comparative and
              co-diversification studies.",
