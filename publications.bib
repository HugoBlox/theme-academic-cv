            In this study, we suggest pretest and shrinkage methods based on the generalised ridge regression estimation that is suitable for both multicollinear and high‐dimensional problems. We review and develop theoretical results for some of the shrinkage estimators. The relative performance of the shrinkage estimators to some penalty methods is compared and assessed by both simulation and real‐data analysis. We show that the suggested methods can be accounted as good competitors to regularisation techniques, by means of a mean squared error of estimation and prediction error. A thorough comparison of pretest and shrinkage estimators based on the maximum likelihood method to the penalty methods. In this paper, we extend the comparison outlined in his work using the least squares method for the generalised ridge regression.},

The usual way is to fit a model using the ordinary least squares regression, which has some assumptions, also known as Gauss-Markov assumptions, on the error term showing white noise process of the regression model. However, in many applications, especially for this example, these assumptions are not satisfied. Therefore, in this study, a quantile regression approach is used to model the respiratory mortality using the mentioned explanatory variables. Moreover, improved estimation techniques such as preliminary testing and shrinkage strategies are also obtained when the errors are autoregressive. A Monte Carlo simulation experiment, including the quantile penalty estimators such as Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net, is designed to evaluate the performances of the proposed techniques. Finally, the theoretical risks of the listed estimators are given.},

We assume in the sparse linear model some of the predictors have very weak influence on the response of interest. We propose to shrink estimators more than usual. Specifically, we use integrated estimation strategies in sub and full models and shrink the integrated estimators by incorporating a bounded measurable function of some weights. The exhibited double shrunken estimators improve the prediction performance of sub models significantly selected from existing Lasso-type variable selection methods. Monte Carlo simulation studies as well as real examples of eye data and Riboavin data confirm the superior performance of the estimators in the high-dimensional regression model.},

            In this study, we suggest pretest and shrinkage methods based on the generalised ridge regression estimation that is suitable for both multicollinear and high‐dimensional problems. We review and develop theoretical results for some of the shrinkage estimators. The relative performance of the shrinkage estimators to some penalty methods is compared and assessed by both simulation and real‐data analysis. We show that the suggested methods can be accounted as good competitors to regularisation techniques, by means of a mean squared error of estimation and prediction error. A thorough comparison of pretest and shrinkage estimators based on the maximum likelihood method to the penalty methods. In this paper, we extend the comparison outlined in his work using the least squares method for the generalised ridge regression.},

	abstract = {An important issue is that the respiratory mortality may be a result of air pollution which can be measured by the following variables: temperature, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrocarbons, ozone and particulates. The usual way is to fit a model using the ordinary least squares regression, which has some assumptions, also known as Gauss-Markov assumptions, on the error term showing white noise process of the regression model. However, in many applications, especially for this example, these assumptions are not satisfied. Therefore, in this study, a quantile regression approach is used to model the respiratory mortality using the mentioned explanatory variables. Moreover, improved estimation techniques such as preliminary testing and shrinkage strategies are also obtained when the errors are autoregressive. A Monte Carlo simulation experiment, including the quantile penalty estimators such as Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net, is designed to evaluate the performances of the proposed techniques. Finally, the theoretical risks of the listed estimators are given.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we apply shrinkage strategies to estimate regression coefficients efficiently for the high-dimensional multiple regression model, where the number of samples is smaller than the number of predictors. We assume in the sparse linear model some of the predictors have very weak influence on the response of interest. We propose to shrink estimators more than usual. Specifically, we use integrated estimation strategies in sub and full models and shrink the integrated estimators by incorporating a bounded measurable function of some weights. The exhibited double shrunken estimators improve the prediction performance of sub models significantly selected from existing Lasso-type variable selection methods. Monte Carlo simulation studies as well as real examples of eye data and Riboavin data confirm the superior performance of the estimators in the high-dimensional regression model.},
