**Credit hours and work expectations:** This is a **3-credit-hour course**. According to Ohio State policy (https://go.osu.edu/credithours) , students should expect around 3 hours per week of time spent on direct instruction (instructor content and Carmen activities, for example) in addition to 6 hours of homework (reading and assignment preparation, for example) to receive a grade of (C) average.  
**Attendance and participation requirements:** Because this is an online course, your attendance is based on your online activity and participation. The following is a summary of students’ expected participation:
- **Participating in online activities for attendance:** {{< hl >}}**AT LEAST ONCE PER WEEK**{{< /hl >}}  
  You are expected to log in to the course in Carmen every week. (During most weeks you will probably log in many times.) If you have a situation that might cause you to miss an entire week of class, discuss it with me as soon as possible.

### Descriptions of major course assignments

#### Discussions
You will have 12 Discussion assignments via Carmen. Every week you must respond to the prompt provided, and then read and reply to at least 2 of your classmates. Your comments should be meaningful (not simply "Yeah, me too" or "I agree").

#### Empirical projects
A key learning element of the course will be six empirical projects, which will give students hands on experience in doing economics and working with data. The purpose of the empirical projects is to
- provide hands-on experience, using real-world data, to investigate important policy problems
- strengthen the link between real-world phenomena and economic concepts and models
- help students to develop skills that are transferable to other courses and to the workplace.

#### Midterm paper
The midterm paper will give you the opportunity to explore one of the topics in this class (or another economic issue of your interests) at depth. You will turn in an approximately 5-page research paper requiring citation of at least 5 academic and/or reputable publications.

#### Final Paper
The final paper will give you the opportunity to continue exploring your topic further, or to explore another topic at depth.
- If you pick the same topic, you will turn in an approximately 10-page research paper addressing midterm paper feedback, with significant additions since your last submission (you can’t simply turn in the same paper).
- If you pick a different topic, you will turn in an approximately 7-page research paper requiring citation of at least 6 academic and/or reputable publications.

#### Final Presentation
The last week of the semester is devoted to students' final presentations. You will submit a 8-10 minute video presentation discussing your economic issue, your findings, and your policy recommendations to address the issue.

### Late Assignments
Late submissions will be accepted on a case-by-case basis. Given the significant difficulties presented by the ongoing pandemic, I will try to be as accommodating and understanding as possible. If you have any problems turning in assignments of time, please don't hesitate to contact me. Please refer to Carmen for due dates.

## Other Course Policies

### Discussion and communication guidelines
The following are my expectations for how we should communicate as a class. Above all, please remember to be respectful and thoughtful.
- Writing style: While there is no need to participate in class discussions as if you were writing a research paper, you should remember to write using good grammar, spelling, and punctuation. A more conversational tone is fine for non-academic topics.
- Tone and civility: Let's maintain a supportive learning community where everyone feels safe and where people can disagree amicably. Remember that sarcasm doesn't always come across online.
- Citing your sources: When we have academic discussions, please cite your sources to back up what you say. For the textbook or other course materials, list at least the title and page numbers. For online sources, include a link.
- Backing up your work: Consider composing your academic posts in a word processor, where you can save your work, and then copying into the Carmen discussion.

### Academic Integrity Policy
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection with examinations. Instructors shall report all instances of alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information, see the Code of Student Conduct https://studentlife.osu.edu/csc/.

### Commitment to a diverse and inclusive learning environment
The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body. Our programs and curricula reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to provide opportunities for students to learn more about persons who are different from them. We are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among each member of our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach his or her own potential. Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status, which is defined as age, color, disability, gender identity or expression, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status, is prohibited.

### Your mental health
As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. No matter where you are engaged in distance learning, The Ohio State University’s Student Life Counseling and Consultation Service (CCS) is here to support you. If you find yourself feeling isolated, anxious or overwhelmed, on-demand resources are available at https://go.osu.edu/ccsondemand. You can reach an on-call counselor when CCS is closed at 614- 292-5766, and 24-hour emergency help is also available through the 24/7 National Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK or at suicidepreventionlifeline.org. The Ohio State Wellness app is also a great resource available at https://go.osu.edu/wellnessapp.

### Statement on Title IX
All students and employees at Ohio State have the right to work and learn in an environment free from harassment and discrimination based on sex or gender, and the university can arrange interim measures, provide support resources, and explain investigation options, including referral to confidential resources.
If you or someone you know has been harassed or discriminated against based on your sex or gender, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, or sexual exploitation, you may find information about your rights and options at https://titleix.osu.edu or by contacting the Ohio State Title IX Coordinator at titleix@osu.edu. Title IX is part of the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) at Ohio State, which responds to all bias-motivated incidents of harassment and discrimination, such as race, religion, national origin and disability.
