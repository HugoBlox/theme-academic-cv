Rethink Priorities, a project of [Rethink Charity](https://rtcharity.org/), is dedicated to doing foundational research on neglected causes in a highly empirical and transparent manner.

In doing this research, we focus on the following principles:

* __Generating new insight and knowledge__ in addition to synthesizing existing research. We’re focused more on producing cutting-edge content rather than summarizing existing content.

* __Publishing shorter and more digestible information more frequently__, rather than publishing sprawling research less frequently. By taking the same amount of information and breaking it down into “minimal publishing units,” we make it easier for ourselves and others to understand and build upon, and get quicker feedback loops.

* __Emphasizing quick feedback loops__ trying to go from initial research to an initial publication in about a month.

* __Seeking tractability in research__ by looking for questions that we may be able to make meaningful progress on. [We’ll hack away on the edges](http://lesswrong.com/lw/8ns/hack_away_at_the_edges/), so to speak.

* __Keeping all research in touch with the bigger picture__, building upon individual publications to try to answer key questions.

* __Finding new opportunities over creating more ranked lists of existing opportunities.__ We predict improving on existing uncertain ranking methods is less effective than finding directions that have been previously neglected in EA. We’re unlikely to convince people of the number one cause, but we might find something others have not thought about.

* __Tracking the impact of our research__ to help us make key decisions. We have plans to do follow-up reviews on all our research, including surveys to determine the influence of the research.

* __Shutting the project down if it doesn’t generate impact__ to avoid wasting our time and effort. We are pre-committing to an initial six month test phase and pivoting as necessary. We will completely shut down if there’s no discernable impact within the first year. If our work isn’t helping others make better decisions, we should try something else.

This work is currently led by Marcus A. Davis and Peter Hurford, with Marcus working full-time and Peter working part-time.  For more information about their backgrounds, see our [team page]({{< ref "/our_team/staff.md" >}}).

Right now, our research agenda is focused on:

* trying to learn how to apply cost-effectiveness frameworks to uncertain domains. (As an example, see our first post on [vaccine research and development]({{< ref "blog/how_long_to_research_develop_vaccine.md" >}}))
* prioritization and research work within interventions aimed at nonhuman animals (as research progress here looks uniquely tractable compared to other cause areas)
* assisting [LEAN](https://rtcharity.org/lean/) and [SHIC](https://shicschools.org/) in gathering evidence about EA movement building (as research here looks tractable and neglected)

Our research agenda and approach are still in the very early stages and may change significantly as we grow and learn.
