My research involves the topics of **analytics** and **operational research**, in particular **prescriptive analytics**, **optimisation**, and **mathematical programming**.

The main focus of my research is the development of **efficient formulations and solution** methods for **decision making under uncertainty** that can be used for improving decision making in real-world problems.

My research interests are methodological developments and applications of mathematical programming to problems in the areas of **supply chain management and production planning**, specifically  *Healthcare and humanitarian systems*, *renewable energy generation*, *process systems planning*, and *logistics management*.
