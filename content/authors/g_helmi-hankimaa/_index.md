My research is focused on developing the [Decision Programming](https://github.com/gamma-opt/DecisionProgramming.jl) framework for solving multi-stage decision problems under uncertainty. My current focus is implementing and testing a tighter formulation of the problem.

In my previous research, I have applied Decision Programming in optimising the decision making process involved in allocating preventative care for coronary heart disease. This particular problem is challenging due to the multiple decision stages, endogenous uncertainties and the large size of the model. Now the goal is to develop Decision Programming so that problems such as this one can be solved more efficiently.
