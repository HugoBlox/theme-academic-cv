Kirsty is a Research Fellow at the Centre for Marine Socioecology in the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies. She is interested in the resilience of marine ecosystems and the functional and spatial ecology of fishes. Her research sits at the nexus between resilience theory and empiricism: she is particularly interested in testing the practical application of theory with empirical data and modelling.
 
Kirsty is also focused on supporting academics achieve work-life balance and has built a free online resource hub [aKIDemic Life](https://akidemiclife.com) to empower parents and carers working in academic settings by providing rapid access to advice, mentoring and funding
