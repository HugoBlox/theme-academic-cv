My research is currently focused on optimization under uncertainty, developing [Decision Programming](https://github.com/gamma-opt/DecisionProgramming.jl) for multi-stage decision problems with exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. 

The applications in my work (such as climate change cost-benefit analysis and water resources planning) feature long-term climate-related uncertainties. These problems are often very hard to solve with existing methods. The goal of my research is to develop methodology that allows for better solving such problems.

My previous research includes retail promotions planning, where I developed a method for [evaluating cannibalization effects between products](https://sal.aalto.fi/publications/pdf-files/ther18_public.pdf).
