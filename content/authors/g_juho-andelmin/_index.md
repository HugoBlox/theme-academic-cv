My previous research includes modeling and developing algorithms (both [exact](https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2016.0734) and [heuristic](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2019.04.018)) for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs), especially in the context of alternative fuel vehicles (e.g., [Electric VRP with Time Windows and Partial Recharges](https://sal.aalto.fi/files/personnel/juho.andelmin/tand14_public.pdf)), where fuel consumption and refueling stations are both included in the routing models. I have also studied [Resource Allocation Problems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2020.03.031) where decision makers wish to (re-)allocate input resources among several decision-making units (e.g., supermarkets, restaurants) to maximize total outputs (e.g., profit, sales) and/or minimize total inputs. 

Currently, I am working on discrete multi-stage decision-making problems under endogenous uncertainty, specifically problems that are represented as Limited Memory Influence Diagrams (LIMIDS) ([Lauritzen & Nilsson, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.47.9.1235.9779)). Our [Decision Programming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09196.pdf) framework proposes a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for discrete multi-stage decision problems represented as LIMIDs. Future plans include developing decomposition algorithms for solving large instances to optimality.
