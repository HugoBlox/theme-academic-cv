Our laboratory is interested in the study of human pathogens, particularly
those that cause so-called *Neglected Tropical Diseases*. 

We leverage computational tools and large data sets to formulate and guide our
research hypotheses in the quest for new drugs and diagnostics. 

In particular, we have a special interest in the study of trypanosomes such as
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ (causative of Chagas disease).
