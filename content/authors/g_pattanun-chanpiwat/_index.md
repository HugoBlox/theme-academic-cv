At Aalto University, he is a Visiting Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, and working with Dr. Fabricio Oliveira. He is currently working on the EasyDR project. This project develops the demand response algorithm based on reinforcement learning for residential households under uncertainty in electricity prices, load demand, and weather conditions. 

His main research interests include Optimization Modeling, Equilibrium/Game Theory Models, Operations Research, and Machine Learning. 

“In this field you can make a real impact, not just with the innovations and solutions, but if you can make a greener world, and make things more efficient, it helps everyone,” Pattanun said. “I believe that the decision based on science and engineering is crucial for us to plan for a better future.”
