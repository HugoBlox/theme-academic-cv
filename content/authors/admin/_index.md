My name is Sophie Fortz and I am a postdoctoral researcher with expertise in software engineering. Currently, I'm deeply involved in quantum programming as part of the VSL-Q project at King's College London. In this exciting project, we are dedicated to providing verified simulation of large-scale quantum systems. Our focus extends beyond the theoretical to the practical, addressing platform specificities, noise and scalability issues. This endeavour represents a collaborative synergy, bringing together experts from diverse fields such as physics, programming languages, and software engineering. Working alongside Prof. Mohammad Reza Mousavi, Iâ€™ll be channeling my previous expertise towards pioneering testing techniques specifically tailored for quantum programs.

Before embarking on this quantum journey, I did a Ph.D. at the University of Namur. Under the guidance of Dr. Gilles Perrouin and Prof. Patrick Heymans, I delved into the intricacies of software engineering. After being funded by the FNRS EoS (Excellence of Science) VeriLearn project for a year, I secured a competitive [FRIA (FNRS) Grant](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/financements-resp/chercheur-doctorant). In September 2023, I successfully defended my thesis, entitled [*"LIFTS: Learning Featured Transition Systems"*](poster). 

On my spare hours, I like to read, [draw and paint](painting). I was also an active member of [the Belgian Guide Federation](guides) for years, where I have been successively girl guide, group leader and trainer.
