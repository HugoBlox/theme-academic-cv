I’m a senior year undergraduate student at Australian National University(ANU) pursuing a bachelor's degree of Advanced Computing(honor), prior to joining the double degree program of ANU, I was studying computer science at Shandong University in China.

My current research is on the topic of variational auto-encoder under the supervision of Prof. Tom Gedeon, I’m also doing some summarizing works with respect to the Graphical Models which is currently under review by my thesis co-supervisor Mr. Zhenyue. My research interests include variational inferences, probabilistic graphical models, convex optimization, etc.
