I am a last-year astronomy student and a software developer with a deep passion for open-source software. 

My professional experience includes developing software for astrophysics, designing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, and
working with machine learning and AI models.

In my spare time, I contribute to open-source projects and enjoy building software packages.
