I am a Research Assistant at Bundeswehr University Munich. I am working on computer vision and deep generative networks for single cell analysis.

I obtained my Master and Bachelor degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Yildiz Techinal University (YTU) under supervision of Prof. Huseyin Uvet. For 6 years, I am member of Advanced System and Innovation Laboratories in YTU as Student Assistant (2017-2020), Research Assistant (2020-2022) and now Engineering Manager (2022-now). Also, I was the Research Engineer at ASELSAN for 6 months in 2020.
