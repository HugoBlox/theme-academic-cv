My name is Sergio Gasquez, I'm a Telecommunications Engineer with Masters in Electronic Systems for Intelligent Environments who loves Firmware and Embedded Systems Programming. I was born in Granada and after graduating, I moved to Barcelona to work as a Firmware Engineer in HP, where I developed security features for the Ink Delivery System. At the beginning of 2020, I reallocated into A Coruña to work as an Embedded Sofware Developer at Instituto Tecnológico de Galicia (ITG) where ITG I was in charge of developing firmware for a ["drone in a box solution"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6RUV0yKewg). In March 2021 I joined RTI as a Software Developer for Connext Micro, a connectivity framework based on the DDS standar for resource-constrained applications.


I am a passionate technologist :man_technologist: who enjoys learning new things :bulb:, especially electronics :robot: and programming :computer:! In my spare time I love doing sports :climbing: :swimming_man: :hiking_boot:, traveling :earth_africa:, and listening music :love_you_gesture:.
