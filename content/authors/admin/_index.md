My name is Sophie Fortz. I am a Ph.D. student in software engineering at the University of Namur, and a member of VERTIGO team. I am also a member of the PReCISE research centre and Namur Digital Institute. I work under the supervision of Gilles Perrouin and Patrick Heymans. After one year of PhD funded by the EoS (Excellence of Science) VeriLearn, I obtained a FRIA (FNRS) Grant. My thesis is entitled: "LIFTS: Learning Featured Transition Systems". My main research interests include variability-intensive systems, behavioural modelling, model-based software testing, AI4SE and SE4AI.

On my spare hours, I like to read and follow drawing/painting classes. I am also an active member of the Belgian Guides Federation, where I have been successively girl guide, group leader and trainer.
