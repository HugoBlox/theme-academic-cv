    summary: |
    I am a PhD student in Sociology at McGill University, specializing in Population Dynamics, with a passion for exploring family trajectories and transitions to adulthood among immigrant groups. I hold a Master’s in Demography and a Bachelor’s in Social Planning, ranking among the top students in both programs. My research focuses on understanding how young immigrants navigate key life events, such as marriage, childbearing, and household formation, in a new cultural context. I aim to highlight that living in a high-income country is not the same experience for immigrants as it is for the native-born, as immigrants often face additional obstacles when adapting to a new place. With expertise in quantitative research methods, data analysis, and demographic modeling, my goal is to contribute to a deeper understanding of immigrant families and their vital role in shaping Canada’s demographic landscape.

      Responsibilities include:
      - Through various projects related to global family changes led by Prof. Clark, my duties included literature review, identifying research gaps, data analysis, preparing presentations, and drafting issue and policy briefs. Recently, one of the issue briefs we worked on, titled "Family change and diversity in Canada," was published by The Vanier Institute of the Family. In this brief, we explained the increased diversity in types of unions and intimate partnerships formed. This collaboration taught me a great deal about working with independent institutes to highlight social changes over the years. Currently, I am a Co-investigator on another research project focusing on Rural Families in Canada.

      Responsibilities include:
      - I am working closely with Dr. Orsola Torrisi to make sure students gain an accurate conceptual understanding and statistical thinking. This course introduces students to the basics of statistics and probability, which are building blocks for much of the research that is done in the Social Sciences. My main responsibility is during Lab sessions and helping students learn how to use statistical concepts and tools especially STATA.
