My name is Sophie Fortz and I am a postdoctoral researcher specializing in software engineering at the University of Namur. My research is conducted under the expert guidance of Dr. Gilles Perrouin and Prof. Patrick Heymans. Additionally, I hold membership in the PReCISE research center and the Namur Digital Institute.

My academic trajectory began with an initial year of PhD funded by the FNRS EoS (Excellence of Science) VeriLearn project, before I secured a competitive [FRIA (FNRS) Grant](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/financements-resp/chercheur-doctorant). 

My doctoral thesis, [*"LIFTS: Learning Featured Transition Systems"*](poster), reflects my passion for exploring topics such as variability-intensive systems, behavioral modeling, model-based software testing, AI4SE and SE4AI.

Currently, I have returned to the EoS VeriLearn project for a brief postdoctoral appointment before transitioning to a new chapter in my academic journey. I am excited to join Professor Mohammad Reza Mousavi's team at King's College, London, where I will be focusing on testing techniques for quantum programs. 

On my spare hours, I like to read and follow [drawing/painting classes](painting). I was also an active member of [the Belgian Guide Federation](guides) for years, where I have been successively girl guide, group leader and trainer.
