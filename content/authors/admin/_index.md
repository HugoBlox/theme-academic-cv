<!-- Biography goes here, make sure to keep this up to date with the updates -->

I am an assistant professor of [Computer Science and Software Engineering
(CSSE)](https://rose-hulman.edu/academics/academic-departments/computer-science-software-engineering/index.html)
at the [Rose-Hulman Institte of Technology](https://rose-hulman.edu/).
I currently run the NeTwork Security and Operating Systems (NeTSoS) research group
at the department. My research focuses on various aspects of systems security,
with focus on networking and operating systems.

I completed my PhD at the [Computer Science
department](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [William H.
Sanders](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/sanders-william.html).  I
mainly worked on various aspects of secure and resilient networking design,
combining practical design principles with game- and control-theoretic analysis.

Outside of the computer world, I am an amateur student of philosophy. My
favorite philosophers are [S&oslash;ren
Kierkegaard](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/) and [Slavoj
&Zcaron;i&zcaron;ek](https://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/).
