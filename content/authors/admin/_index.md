I am a P.h.D. candidate at the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, advised by Professor [William H. Sanders](http://whs.crhc.illinois.edu).
I mainly work on various aspects of secure and resilient networking design, combining practical
design principles with game- and control-theoretic analysis. 
My ultimate research objective is to integrate theoretical analysis along with practical design
patterns to build secure and resilient networks and systems. 

I have a passion for learning, teaching, and the overall exchange of knowledge. I have taught [ECE
541: Computer System Analysis](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece541/fa2018/) and have been a
Teaching Assistant for the Operating Systems course at UIUC. I am a big fan of teaching Linux kernel
programming and learning new things about the kernel. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
Outside of the computer world, I am an amateur student of philosophy. My favorite philosophers are
[S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/) and [Slavoj
&Zcaron;i&zcaron;ek](https://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/).
