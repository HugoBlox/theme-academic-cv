I am a PhD candidate in Engineering Science at Oxford University. At Oxford, I am part of the Machine Learning Research Group and a member of the Oxford-Man-Institute of Quantitative Finance.

My main research interests lie in machine learning methods for natural language processing and applications for financial market modelling and economic forecasting. I am supervised by Prof. Stephen Roberts and Dr. Jan-Peter Calliess.

I obtained an MPhil in Economics from Oxford University. I also earned an M.Sc. degree in Specialised Economic Analysis from Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.

Previously, I have worked as a Consultant with McKinsey & Company and as a Graduate Trainee Economist with the European Central Bank.
