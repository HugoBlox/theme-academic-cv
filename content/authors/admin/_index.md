I am a postdoctoral researcher in Automatic Control at [IFSTTAR](http://www.ifsttar.fr/en/welcome/). My recent research interests include Networked Control Systems (NCS), Cyberphysical Systems (CPS),  Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Previously, I did my PhD at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr)/[CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr) with the [NeCS](http://necs.inrialpes.fr) team developing *Short-term Forecasting* and *estimation* techniques for large scale traffic networks. Currently, I work within the [LICIT](http://www.licit.ifsttar.fr) team working on control techniques for connected and automated vehicles (CAV)s. In this team I develop traffic flow models and traffic simulation algorithms for truck platoon strategies.

I am also passioned about the Data Science community and the recent work developed around reproducible research. Fan of [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd) and python.
