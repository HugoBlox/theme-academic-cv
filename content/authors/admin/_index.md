I am an expert in human learning and development with 6+ years of experience designing, managing, and executing cutting edge research projects. I recently graduated with my PhD in Psychology from Indiana University. I work in Dr. Linda Smith's Cognitive Development Lab studying early world learning and object recognition, specifically how the statistical structure of infants' early environments shape learning. 

I am excitedly pursuing a career in behavioral research in industry because I want to directly impact the learning experiences of people on a global scale. I am eager to apply my research expertise to enabling learners to reach their full potential with technology!

I am a wiz at secondary data analysis of large corpora as well as experimental design. I am skilled in ego-centric data collection, including head-mounted eyetracking which I have done with participants of ALL ages. I am very comfortable with public speaking, and I have given talks and posters at 9 international research conferences. I have also been published in top academic journals.

In my free time, I love to bake and bullet journal. I am also passionate about dance â€” I have been dancing since I was 3!
