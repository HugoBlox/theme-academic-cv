I am undergraduate student passionates in the fields of machine learning ,deep learning and algorithm. I spent my first two years of  college life in Shandong University which equipped me with solid programming and mathematics skills. I am currently studying computer vision and neural network at ANU, hoping to get a research opportunity in relative fields.
