I am a DPhil student in Economics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/#/). I work on the economic impact on automation, with a specific interest in firms and the labour market. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at [St Hilda's College](https://www.st-hildas.ox.ac.uk/) in Oxford, before working at data analytics consultancy [dunnhumby](https://www.dunnhumby.com/). I embarked on graduate study at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), taking courses in statistics and machine learning, before returning to [Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/#/) to train as an economist. I have taught undergraduate economics throughout my studies, and I am particularly interested in [various approaches](https://www.core-econ.org/teaching-macroeconomics/) to changing the economics syllabus.
