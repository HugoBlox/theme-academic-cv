## About Me

I’m a Graduate Research Assistant at **CIVS (PNW)** working at the intersection of **computer vision**, **LLMs**, and **cloud-native engineering**.  
I build real-time safety systems—YOLO-based detection, multi-camera tracking, and polygon hazard zones—paired with **vision-grounded language models** that explain risks and generate incident summaries.  

Previously, I was an **SRE at Asite**, where I automated Azure/AWS infrastructure with **Terraform**, built CI/CD with **Jenkins + Ansible**, and deployed monitoring with **Prometheus/Grafana**.  
I enjoy turning research ideas into production-ready, observable systems that run reliably at the edge or in the cloud.
