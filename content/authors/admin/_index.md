I am a Machine Learning Scientist / Engineer with over 5 years industry experience as a data scientist and machine learning engineer and 4 years experience as an academic researcher and scientist. I am a specialist in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) with a particular interest in dialogue and question-answer systems.

I have worked on various industry applications including: building dialogue and question-answer systems at a peer-to-peer chat technology startup; text summarization systems for news media; and developing a semantic search engine for company discovery. I have worked across several industries including: technology & innovation; interactive entertainment & video games; news media; healthcare & neuroscience; and human-computer interaction.
