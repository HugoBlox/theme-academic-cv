Update: I will start my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) in Fall 2022.

I am currently a research assistant in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/). My research interests are in the areas of machine learning, information theory, signal processing, and their applications in healthcare.

Previously, I received an M.Sc. in Mathematics from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in 2021 and a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics from [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) in 2019. I have been involved in research in spectral graph theory, algebraic structures, compressed sensing, and group testing.
