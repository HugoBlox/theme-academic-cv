## About Me

My name is Sophie Fortz and I am a postdoctoral researcher with expertise in software engineering. Currently, I'm deeply involved in quantum programming as part of the VSL-Q project at King's College London. In this exciting project, we are dedicated to providing verified simulation of large-scale quantum systems. Our focus extends beyond the theoretical to the practical, addressing platform specificities, noise and scalability issues. This endeavour represents a collaborative synergy, bringing together experts from diverse fields such as physics, programming languages, and software engineering. Working alongside Prof. Mohammad Reza Mousavi, I’ll be channeling my previous expertise towards pioneering testing techniques specifically tailored for quantum programs.

Before embarking on this quantum journey, I did a Ph.D. at the University of Namur. Under the guidance of Dr. Gilles Perrouin and Prof. Patrick Heymans, I delved into the intricacies of software engineering. After being funded by the FNRS EoS (Excellence of Science) VeriLearn project for a year, I secured a competitive [FRIA (FNRS) Grant](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/financements-resp/chercheur-doctorant). In September 2023, I successfully defended my thesis, entitled [*"LIFTS: Learning Featured Transition Systems"*](activities/poster). 

On my spare hours, I like to read, [draw and paint](activities/painting). I was also an active member of [the Belgian Guide Federation](activities/guides) for years, where I have been successively girl guide, group leader and trainer.
