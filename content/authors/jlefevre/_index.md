My research interests are in cloud databases, database physical design, and storage systems. I currently lead the [Skyhook: programmable storage for databases project](https://skyhookdm.com) as part of the [Center for Research on Open Source Software](https://cross.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz. Skyhook is an open source project that extends Ceph distributed object storage with customized data management functions. I also collaborate with the Systems Research Lab on the larger [programmable storage](http://www.programmability.us/) effort. The Skyhook project is also part of [Google Summer of Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4813203146539008/), where we mentor a student working on data formats for Skyhook.

I received my PhD in June 2014 from UC Santa Cruz Database group and subsequently joined Hewlett Packard Big Data R&D (Vertica database) where I worked on integrating Vertica with external analtyics engines such as Distributed-R and Apache Spark. At UC Santa Cruz my PhD advisor was [Neoklis Polyzotis](https://research.google.com/pubs/NeoklisPolyzotis.html) and my PhD thesis title is "Physical design tuning methods for emerging system architectures". My [thesis](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7ck0q3nn) ([abstract](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~jlefevre/abstract.txt)) introduces new physical design methods for databases in the cloud. Specifically I address RDBMS, Hadoop, and hybrid 'multistore' (combined RDBMS + Hadoop co-processing) system architectures.

Previously, I received my MS from the [University of California, San Diego](http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/) in the [Systems and Networking Group](http://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/). My MS advisor was [Walt Burkhard](http://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=100) and my MS thesis title is "Improving disk array performance and reliability", which introduces a data layout and scheduling policy for RAID arrays. I received a BS in Computer Science & Engineering from the [University of South Florida](http://www.cse.usf.edu/), where I did research on unique encodings for DNA languages. During graduate school I spent several summers at NEC Labs working on CloudDB in the Data Management group, at Google in the Platforms Storage group, and at Teradata in the Virtual Storage Architecture group.
