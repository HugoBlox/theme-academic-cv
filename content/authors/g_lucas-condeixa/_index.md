Lucas works with optimization methods under uncertainty for systems analysis.

His PhD research focuses on developing mathematical models for power systems Generation, Transmission, and Storage Expansion Planning (GTSEP). He is currently engaged with the implications of temporal reduction in GTSEP using different clustering algorithms.
