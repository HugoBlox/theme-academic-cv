Camilla is originally from Italy, where she graduated from bachelor and master degrees in marine ecology. She had always dreamed about living in Australia, so she moved to Hobart to do her PhD, which focused on evaluating baseline conditions and resulting changes in demersal fish communities of South East Australia. During this time, her interest in understanding human impacts on marine systems and the balance between conservation and exploitation of natural resources for long-term use grew. She enjoyed the PhD experience in Hobart and decided to stay for a postdoc.

Camilla is currently working on extending size-spectrum ecosystem models to include fleet dynamics. This is to better understand fisherâ€™s response to changes in biological and economic conditions of a fishery and to predict the consequences that such behaviour might have on ecosystem structure and function. This project is a collaborative effort between CSIRO and CMS, and my main collaborators are Beth Fulton, Julia Blanchard, Ingrid Van Putten and Fabio Boschetti.
