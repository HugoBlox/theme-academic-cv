Hi! I live in Porto, Portugal, where I split my time between industry and academy. I am currently the product lead at [Velocidi](https://www.velocidi.com/), a NY-based AdTech startup. In the academy, I am an assistant lecturer at the [Faculty of Engineering from the University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=479881). In between, I have made my way towards a Ph.D. in Informatics Engineering, researching patterns and the adoption of cloud architectures, which is currently pending defense. I love music, movies, and sharing a good meal with friends.
