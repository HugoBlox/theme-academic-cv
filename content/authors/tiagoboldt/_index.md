I live in Porto, Portugal, where I divide my time between industry and academy. In the industry, I am currently product lead at Velocidi, a NY-based AdTech startup. In the academy, I work as an assistant lecturer at the Faculty of Engineering from the University of Porto (FEUP). In between, I have worked towards my Ph.D. in Informatics Engineering, researching patterns for Cloud architectures.
