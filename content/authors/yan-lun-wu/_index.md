Yan-Lun is a PhD student originally from National Taiwan Ocean University, where she graduated with a Bachelor and a Master of Marine in Fishery Sciences   . Currently, she is an academic visitor in the Size Ecology lab, where she is working on biomass variations of several tuna species and their preys under climate change conditions of the central Pacific Ocean. During her time at the lab, she is focusing on understanding size spectrum dynamics and how to apply them to her case study using the Mizer model. Her objective is to explore how fish communities vary in their environment when under pressure, such as over-fishing and global warming.
