Computational biologist focused on genomic regulation and data integration. 12 years of experience in biological data analysis using the most well-established tools and contributing to novel algorithms to improve the quantification and visualization of genomic data. I approach scientific challenges with passion and believe that a collaboration and not an individual alone can successfully conquer them.
