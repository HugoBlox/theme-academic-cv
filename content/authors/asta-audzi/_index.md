Asta has an interdisciplinary research background in evolutionary biology, ecological modelling and molecular ecology, and worked in four different research organisations in four countries. Her current research focuses on understanding how human induced changes in growth and reproductive schedules of marine organisms (life-histories) and redistributions of species are affecting marine ecosystem function, productivity and resilience.

Personally, Asta is especially interested in how we model body size and growth, and in the importance of big fish for populations and ecosystems. Her long-term research goal is to ensure we properly protect largest fish and shellfish in marine ecosystems.
