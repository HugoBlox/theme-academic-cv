# About me 

I specialize in the use of bioinformatics to process data and draw conclussions from biological experiments, specially those resulting in large amounts of data, such as high-throughput microarrays. I also use said data to create predictors that infer new biological knowledge or help designing new experiments.

I'm doing a PhD in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology in the "Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas" (IIB) at the "Universidad de San Martín" (UNSAM, Argentina).

I gave talks about my research at the "VIII Congreso Argentino de Bioinformática y Biología Computacional" (Argentina, Misiones, 2017) and at “ASTMH 67th Annual Meeting” (United Stated, New Orleans, 2018), amongst other places.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA).
