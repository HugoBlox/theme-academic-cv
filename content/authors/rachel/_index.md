Rachel Neville is a postdoctoral researcher at the Inversity of Arizona. She studies pattern forming systems using tools from algebraic topology. 

She is also one of the directors of the Women in STEM Peer Mentorship Project at the University of Arizona. 

When she is not doing math, she is probably hiking.
