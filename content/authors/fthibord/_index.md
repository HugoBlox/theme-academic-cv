As a PhD student in bioinformatics, I'm studying the relationship between miRNA expression levels and haemostatic traits, by using and developping advanced bioinformatics and biostatistical methodologies on epidemiological datasets. I am in particular keen to extend my knowledge on regulatory mechanisms of gene expression and I always look forward to work with new people and contribute to exciting discoveries.


### My tools

[optimiR](https://github.com/FlorianThibord/OptimiR) : a miRSeq data alignment workflow that integrates genetic information to assess the impact of variants on miRNA expression
