# About me 

I began my academic career at the University of Habana (UH), Cuba, with a degree in Biochemistry in 2001. In 2006, I obtained a MSc degree in Protein Chemistry and Enzymology from UH and began my PhD work at this institution, focused on the identification, isolation and characterization of tight-binding inhibitors -from autochthonous natural sources- for cysteine proteases from the parasites Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas Disease) and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria). After several years of PhD work, I moved to Argentine in 2012 and completed my PhD on biochemistry and molecular biology in 2013, working at the Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas, Universidad Nacional de San Martín (IIBIO-UNSAM). I have developed the rest of my academic career at IIBIO-UNSAM working in the identification of synthetic protease inhibitors as antiparasitic agents; first as postdoctoral fellow of the Argentine National Council for Science and Technology (CONICET) and since 2019, as an Assistant Investigator from CONICET. My current research interests include: The development of high-throughput capable enzymatic assays for the identification of target-specific inhibitors and the use of chemogenomic approaches for the reposition of bioactive compounds to a variety of parasitic diseases. I combine research with teaching activities in the Biotechnology career at IIBIO-UNSAM (Protein Biochemistry and Human Genetics).
