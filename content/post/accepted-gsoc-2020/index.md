This is my first blog post. I am excited to be working with [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) and [Econ-Ark](https://econ-ark.org/) this summer as a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student. I will be working on implementing initial GPU support for [HARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK) models.
