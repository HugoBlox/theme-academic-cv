Everyone can make a difference. If you care about something, stand up, put yourself out there and do something.

The smallest thing can make a difference and if enough people do something small the change can be huge. We live in a world that is full of advancements and luxuries that where science fiction a few decades ago. Yet, we have a world that is so full of sadness and darkness. I want people to know that they can make a difference.

I want to see and hear people talk about what they care about without being negative. I want to hear and see
eople make a difference. I believe that we can all make a difference, I believe this deep in my heart.
I enjoy motivation quotes and information. Below is a Twitter moment that I created where I add tweets
that I find motivational.

How can you make a difference? Small acts of kindness are one way. Everyone is battling something,
you don't know what they are battling. Small acts of kindness can have a wonderful impact on someone.
