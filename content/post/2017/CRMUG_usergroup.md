Last year I attended the CRMUG Summit in Tampa and have to say I was very impressed with everything that I
was involved in. During the summit I attended two classes in the Black Belt Series and completed the series
when I returned to Pittsburgh. The information that I learned in this series I put to immediate use on our
Dynamics 365 project. I also met with a local Pittsburgh Chapter leader and discussed participating in the local chapter.

This past January, I facilitated the first meeting of CRMUG Pittsburgh at the Microsoft Office . We have a
very good discussion about the local chapter and how it can benefit others. We talked about the value of the user group
and what we would like to have presented and discussed in future local meetings.
The local chapter is a place to learn from other users, vendors and Microsoft about Dynamics 365. This is a place to enhance
your network of people who you can discuss ideas and ask for help. Vendors at the group do NOT do sales pitches, this is
part of the rules of the group. They are they to support the community and build relations. User, like myself are there
to learn, teach and discuss ideas.
