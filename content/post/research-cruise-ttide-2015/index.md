In January and March 2015 I went on two research cruises on R/V Roger Revelle to the Tasman Sea. I oversaw technical details, logistics, deployments and recoveries of the 15 TTIDE moorings, some of them full ocean depth down to 4000 m. The TTIDE project aimed at understanding the dissipation and reflection of internal tides impinging on a continental shelf. Working close to the Southern Ocean turned out to be quite challenging with strong winds and high seas for most of the time.
