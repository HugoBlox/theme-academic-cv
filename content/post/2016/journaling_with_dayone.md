I have been keeping a journal for a long time. I find it very therapeutic to write my
thoughts down and reflect on them. I started with pen and paper, writing entries in
notebooks. The last few years I started to use [Day One](http://www.dayoneapp.com) on
my iPhone. I wanted to have a way of having my journal with me so I could record my thoughts whenever
and wherever I was. I tried a few other applications on my phone, I really wanted
something that I could use on my computer and iPhone. Day One currently works on
Apple products but the intuitive user interface and stability of the application is
well worth it. I have used it on my iPhone and also used it on an iPad and found
it to be a clean interface. I am able to just write what I am thinking and move on
to what I am doing. I record simple thoughts throughout the day. I have tried other
apps several times but keep coming back to Day One because I find this system to be
so well put together and it lets me focus on my thoughts.

I use a Windows laptop which was a limitation with Day One until very recently. I
have tried using the third party apps but didn�t really like working with a Windows app.
I wanted something that was web based and can be used anywhere but have a full keyboard.
Most of my entries are created using an iPhone but at times I like to write more detail
and prefer to type on a full computer. If you are a Mac user, Day One has a Mac app
which I have used on my kid�s Mac Book Air. This works wonderful, but I use Windows
most of the time (for now).

This month Day One released an update that includes a channel on IFTT which makes
it possible to use other platforms to record your entries. I was very excited
about this release and quickly looked into how I could use this to better
record my thoughts.

If you�re not familiar with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) (**If This Then That**), it�s a free web-based service
that allows users to create chains of simple conditional statements, called �recipes�,
which are triggered based on changes to other web services. IFTTT is a great way to
automatically add content from many web services including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
and more. You can even set up an SMS trigger to create a journal entry via text message!

I am an avid Evernote user, but keep my journal separate from my notes. With the
addition of IFTTT I create a �recipe� that will take a note that I tag with #DayOne
and save it to my journal in Day One. This is huge for me, I can very easily type on
any computer with a web browser using Evernote and tag it with #DayOne and it is
saved to DayOne. I love this feature and was excited to have it available.
(I know, I am a geek). :)

I also have an Apple Watch and have the Day One app installed on it as well.
When I first heard that Day One released an Apple Watch app I was not thrilled but
after using it I have to say it is amazing. A large amount of my entries come through
my Apple Watch now. I simple dictate into the watch and the entry is saved. I also
have shortcuts that I used on the Apple Watch. I have a shortcut that I used to
record when I take my medicine so I don�t forget if I have taken it already. I will
use it to �check in� at a place, so I can very easily without saying anything
check in to the location using GPS and an entry is recorded and I can go back
later to fill in details.

As you can see in the above image I have reminders set to prompt me for creating
journal entries. I like to have this prompt to think of what I am grateful for
each day and the reminder is set to add the tag �grateful� to the entry.

I have a separate journal for different types of entries. I have one for just
personal thoughts, one for work and now have one for ideas on blogging about.
They are easily separated and can be �tagged� with more information if I wish.
Picture logging is another feature I use often, I don�t always want to
share the pics, sometimes I just want to record them for myself or my family to
later see. I will take a few pictures and add them to a journal entry, add some
text if I wish or come back and add the text later.

If you have questions about how I use it or suggestions on other uses I would
love to hear them. Reach out to me at @LJRAIN or here in the comments.
