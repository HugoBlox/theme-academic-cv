I started using Evernote back in 2011 and have found it to be so valuable to my everyday life. I use Evernote
to log notes about my professional and personal life.

I keep my notes in Evernote organized with tags and notebooks. I have found it so easy to find information
that I created. The ability to have my notes with me on my phone and computer made information easily available at anytime.
I will never forgot when we first went to Disney World and had an issue on our first day. I was able to
pull up the notes that I recorded and all information so fast with my phone. I just grabbed my phone, opened
Evernote and searched for Disney.

The situation was very easily resolved and we enjoyed a wonderful magical vacation at Disney.
Since then I have been using Evernote even more. The Evernote Web Clipper opened even more possibilities
for me. I created a notebook called Articles To Read and clip articles to this notebook to read later.
I can highlight sections in the article to make the information even more valuable to me.
When I talk to people about Evernote I also show how I can snap a picture and search for the text in the
picture so easily and fast. I am always so excited when I do this. I know, I am a geek! ðŸ™‚
I have seen Evernote Ambassadors, tweeted with them and read their blogs and books. I wanted to become one!
I believe in Evernote so much that I just want to share how I use it and help others use Evernote
and learn from how they use Evernote.

A few years ago I was asked to give a few presentations at a professional development day for a local
school district. I proposed one talk on Evernote and one on Agile. Both talks went excellent. I showed
how I used Evernote and talked with the administrators and teachers about how they could use
it for themselves. We created accounts and installed Evernote on their devices. It was a great
success and another proud moment in my Evernote history.

Recently I found out about the [Evernote Community Leader program](https://evernote.com/community). I applied for the
Evernote Community Leader program. I then took a very detailed course about using Evernote,
organizing and the different levels of the Evernote Service. I had great discussions with other people in the program.

When I received an email that I was accepted to be an Evernote Community Leader I was so excited!
Now, I as an Evernote Community Leader I have some goals that I would like to achieve and would
love to talk to anyone about using Evernote.

- Write blog posts about using Evernote
- Facilitate workshops on using Evernote
- Offer advice and consulting on Evernote
- Create an Evernote Community Leader discussion group on use Educational Technology
