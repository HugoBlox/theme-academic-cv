Sometime you may find it useful to de-select an Item on ComboBox,
when you try to force a user to pick one from the list.

Here it is the code sample to deselect a selected item on ComboBox in Silverlight.
[Just need to set the selected Index to -1]

```
ComboBox1.SelectedIndex=-1
```

Hope you find it useful.
