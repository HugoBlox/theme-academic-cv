New Orleans is one of my favorite cities to visit. The food, the sights, the art. Here are a bunch of photos we took!

## Lafayette Cemetery

We took a trip to Lafeyette Cemetery! Well, one of them. (Click on a photo to lightbox.)

## Voodoo Museum

Then we went to the New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum, of course.

Oh, and if you're wandering through the French Quarter, make sure to stop into Galatoires and ask for the Sazerac with a history lesson and the "special pour."
