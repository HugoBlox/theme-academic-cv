<p>New Orleans is one of my favorite cities to visit. The food, the sights, the art. Here are a bunch of photos we took!</p>
<div id="lafayette-cemetery" class="section level2">
<h2>Lafayette Cemetery</h2>
<p>We took a trip to Lafeyette Cemetery! Well, one of them. (Click on a photo to lightbox.)</p>
<p>{{&lt; gallery album=“lafayette-cemetery” &gt;}}</p>
</div>
<div id="voodoo-museum" class="section level2">
<h2>Voodoo Museum</h2>
<p>Then we went to the New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum, of course.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you’re wandering through the French Quarter, make sure to stop into Galatoires and ask for the Sazerac with a history lesson and the “special pour.”</p>
