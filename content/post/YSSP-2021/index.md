The *$\Gamma$-opt* group will be participating in the [Young Scientists Summer Program](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/education/yssp/Young_Scientists_Summer_Program.html)(YSSP). The program is organised annually by [International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis](https://iiasa.ac.at/)(IIASA), from 1 June to 31 August.  The IIASA is an independent, international research institute with National Member Organizations in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Through its research programs and initiatives, the institute conducts policy-oriented research into issues that are too large or complex to be solved by a single country or academic discipline. This includes pressing concerns that affect the future of all of humanity, such as climate change, energy security, population ageing, and sustainable development. 

The YSSP is designed for PhD students working on topics compatible with IIASA’s ongoing research and willing to advance their research under the direct supervision of experienced IIASA scientists, and at the same time contribute to IIASA’s ongoing scientific agenda. From June through August accepted participants work within one of nine Institute’s research programs:
* Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases
* Advanced Systems Analysis
* Ecosystem Services and Management
* Energy
* Evolution and Ecology                                  
* Risk and Resilience
* Transitions to New Technologies
* Water
* World Population 

 During the summer 2021 program, the *$\Gamma$-opt* group will be collaborating with IIASA [Advancing Systems Analysis Program](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/asa.html) scientists [Nikolay Khabarov](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/EcosystemsServicesandManagement/-Khabarov--Nikolay-.en.html) and [Alexey Smirnov](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/EcosystemsServicesandManagement/Smirnov--Alexey.en.html) to study the optimal transmission network expansion planning and its welfare effects, considering the market competition between the generation and storage investors.
