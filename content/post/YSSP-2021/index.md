The programm is organised annulay by [International Institie for Applied Systems Analysis](https://iiasa.ac.at/)(IIASA), from 1 June to 31 August.  The IIASA is an independent, international research institute with National Member Organizations in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe.

The YSSP is designed for PhD students working on topics compatable with IIASA’s ongoing research and willing to advance their research under the direct supervision of experienced IIASA scientists, and at the same time contribute to IIASA’s ongoing scientific agenda. 

During the program, the *$\Gamma$-opt* group will be collaborating with IIASA Advancing Systems Analysis Program scientists [Nikolay Khabarov](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/EcosystemsServicesandManagement/-Khabarov--Nikolay-.en.html) and [Alexey Smirnov](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/EcosystemsServicesandManagement/Smirnov--Alexey.en.html) to study the optimal transmission network expansion planning and its welfare effects, considering the market competition between the generation and storage investors.
