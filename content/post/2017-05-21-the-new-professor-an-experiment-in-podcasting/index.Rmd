Since I don't talk into a microphone enough teaching fully online (hah... hah... haaaah), I figured I'd up my game and start a podcast! I'm about halfway done building and recording three-or-so episodes to start before syndication in iTunes, Stitcher, etc. 

I've decided to brand it **[The New Professor](https://thenewprofessor.com)** to reflect both my new position (Assistant Professor) and my experience in higher education, a realm oft plagued by aversion to change and progress to match the frenetic pace of industry, commerce, and culture. 

Keep an eye out for this in the coming weeks. In the meantime, feel free to begin following TNP's [Twitter](http://twitter.com/newprofcast) account and like the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/thenewprofessor/).
