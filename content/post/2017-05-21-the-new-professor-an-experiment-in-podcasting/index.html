<p>Since I don’t talk into a microphone enough teaching fully online (hah… hah… haaaah), I figured I’d up my game and start a podcast! I’m about halfway done building and recording three-or-so episodes to start before syndication in iTunes, Stitcher, etc.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to brand it <strong><a href="https://thenewprofessor.com">The New Professor</a></strong> to reflect both my new position (Assistant Professor) and my experience in higher education, a realm oft plagued by aversion to change and progress to match the frenetic pace of industry, commerce, and culture.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for this in the coming weeks. In the meantime, feel free to begin following TNP’s <a href="http://twitter.com/newprofcast">Twitter</a> account and like the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thenewprofessor/">Facebook page</a>.</p>
