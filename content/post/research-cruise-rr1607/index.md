We spent three weeks on R/V Roger Revelle to study flow-topography interactions in the vicinity of Palau in the tropical North Pacific.

This was my first time as a co-PI on a research cruise. Together with leading the nightwatch and responsibility for six mooring deployments and one mooring recovery this turned out to be a very busy cruise. It was very rewarding as we did a ton of interesting science though!
