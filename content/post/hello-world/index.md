This is the website of our research group *$\Gamma$-opt* (read Gamma-opt), which stands for **Group of Applied Mathematical Modelling And OPTimisation**. We were founded at some point in 2019, and we are part of the Systems Analysis Laboratory, with the department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis at Aalto University.

We will use this as a plaform to share what we have been doing in terms of research and teaching, hoping this can be a way for people be inspired to make contact and collaborate with us.

We will also use this wesite as a portal to all our academic outputs, such as papers, conference talks, and code. Please feel free to browse and being in contact in case there is someting that sparks your interest.
