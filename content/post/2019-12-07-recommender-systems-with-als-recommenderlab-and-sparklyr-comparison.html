<p>I will use the Yelp dataset to compare recommendation system implementations in recommenderlab and sparklyr.
Data can be found on Yelp <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge">here</a></p>
<p>The Yelp datasets are stored in JSON file format and are quite large. Using high performance methods will be important. Below I write a function to transform the JSON files into dataframes. I use the jsonlite package to efficiently stream in and flatten the files. I will have 3 dataframes: users, reviews, and businesses.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fl_json &lt;- function(filen, ps = psize) {
  direc &lt;- paste0(getwd(), &#39;/&#39;, filen, &#39;.json&#39;)
  df &lt;- jsonlite::stream_in(file(direc), pagesize = ps)
  df &lt;- jsonlite::flatten(df)
  return(df)
}


users&lt;-fl_json(filen=&quot;user&quot;,10000)


rev&lt;-fl_json(filen=&quot;review&quot;,100000)


busn&lt;-fl_json(filen=&quot;business&quot;,10000)</code></pre>
<p>Here is what the dataframes look like…</p>

<p>Before attempting to use sparklyr, I will use data.table as a benchmark. It will definitely speed up pre-processing over dplyr.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#change to data.tables
map_df(list(busn,users,revs),~setDT(.))

#join reviews to users &amp; businesses dataframes
revs&lt;-revs[users[,.(user_id,review_count)],on=&quot;user_id&quot;]
revs&lt;-revs[busn[,.(business_id,review_count)],on=&quot;business_id&quot;]

setnames(revs,c(&quot;review_count&quot;,&quot;i.review_count&quot;),c(&quot;user_count&quot;,&quot;bus_count&quot;))</code></pre>
<div id="data-exploration" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
<p>How does the frequency of a user leaving a review impact his/her probability of leaving a high review?
Are users with more reviews more likely to give a higher/lower rating?
Below, I use the purrr list column workflow to nest a dataframe containing all reviews a given star rating (1-5).
Then, I write a function to build the probability distributions for each star rating. This probability is a function of the number of reviews a user is given.</p>
<p>For example, if a user has given 100 reviews, what is the probability that she gives a 4 star rating?</p>
<p>This is P(user gives star i| user has given n reviews) for stars i=1:4 amd reviews n= 1:5000</p>

<p>This is interesting. It appears that as the number of reviews a person gives increase, their probability of leaving a one or five star review decreases. By contrast, their probability of leaving a 3 or 4 star review increases. So maybe people become jaded and start to think of everything as “average.”</p>
<p>To answer my initial question: if a user has given 100 reviews, what is the probability that she gives star rating i (i=1-5)?</p>
