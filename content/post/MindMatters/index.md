# Detecting there is a real problem with you

These are the ways I realize I have a problem and have to find a solution for it.

# 

## Are you okay? You seem distant/reflective

This is the red flag for me, if somebody that knows me tells me I seem distant or reflective, this means something is wrong with me.
Normally, it takes several days for me to realize exactly what's wrong. 

# Introspection

How can I find in me the answers to my problems.

# Social lies

Why do we feel the need to transmit everything is okay?

# The problem

I need to exercise my brain. At my job, I don't get the opportunity to do it as often as I would like. I therefore need other options. These are: Sport, Hobbies or social activities.

# The solution

I have to do sport, find a hobbie and get involved in more social activities.
