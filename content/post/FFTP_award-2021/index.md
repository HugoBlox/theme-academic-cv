I have had the pleasure of being awarded the Outstanding Teacher of the Year Award from the [Tekniikan Edistamissäätiö](https://tekniikanedistamissaatio.fi/), the Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion. The foundation supports education and research developments in the field of technology in Finland.

My nomination was put forward by [Fyysikkokilta](https://www.fyysikkokilta.fi/), the association of the Engineering Physics and Mathematics students at the Aalto University, to whom I am very grateful. These students are my greatest source of motivation to keep improving the courses, and my teaching overall.

Here is the full interview I gave regarding the award: [Aalto News](https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/aalto-mathematics-professor-wins-outstanding-teacher-of-the-year-from-the-finnish-foundation).
