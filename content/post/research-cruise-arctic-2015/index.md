Late August and September 2015 in the Beaufort Sea on R/V Sikuliaq to study how upper ocean turbulent mixing will change under ice-free conditions in a warmer climate. Increased turbulent mixing may bring up warmer Atlantic water from beneath the cold surface layer causing a positive feedback on Arctic sea ice retreat.

We deployed a mooring in the central Beaufort Sea and carried out shipboard measurements with SWIMS and MMP.
