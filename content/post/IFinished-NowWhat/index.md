You would think a recently graduated CS student with a stable job at a pretty cool startup has everything figured out right? Let me tell you my story.

# Introduction

I have always made decisions in life based on the "Feeling" I had about them at that given time. 
This technique has proved invaluable up until now as I can't think of a single time it hasn't rendered the best case scenario.
Arguably, I could be at a local high and be unaware of the global high, taking another route may have lead me to.
In any case, I'm very satisfied with it's efficiency... Up until now.

During my last year studying Software Engineering I had to do an internship at a software company of my choice (Providing the company accepted my request) this was later evaluated and I was graded accordingly to my performance.
It is pretty common for the software company (In my case, [WaveApplication](https://waveapplication.com/)) to make you a work offer if they think you are fit for the job.

# Figuring out the problem

When my internship finished, they approached me and asked me if I was interested in continuing to work with them, so during the remaining of the course, I also worked part-time at [WaveApplication](https://waveapplication.com/) where I continued working as a QA engineer. 

When I finished my degree, we updated my contract to full-time and I continued working as a QA engineer.
In retrospect, I see that when I was studying, I never had the time to think about what I wanted to specialize at in the future so this seamless transition from university to work didn't give me enough time to think about what I wanted to specialize at.

# What can I do to fix it?

I realize I'm not able to wake up one morning and just know what I want to do but the fact that I haven't given myself the time to really think about what I want is, in deed part of the problem.

Since I've been working at [WaveApplication](https://waveapplication.com/) as a QA engineer, I've come across several different parts of the business.
From Clients, such as Android to Back-End.
I realized during this time I don't think I want to work with Android or iOS.
I think I would prefer working as a back-end engineer although I'm a very curious guy and I don't think I am able to
