<h2>Grand Floridian Hotel Reviews: Sentiment Analysis and NLP</h2>
<p>The data for this analysis was obtained from the reviews posted on TripAdvisor. I used RSelenium and rvest to extract the data from the first 3000 dynamic web-pages on the TripAdvisor site, which was 2,350 reviews in total. The code used to do this is published on my GitHub. Here, I load the the Rda file I saved from that extraction.</p>

## 1 We have stayed throughout the Deluxe resorts on Disney property.  We are a Disney family and have &quot;grown up&quot; in our accommodation needs starting at Animal Kingdom, through the Epcot resorts and this year, our first year staying at the Grand Floridian. With older kids, we decided to make this our home for our stay this year and we couldn&#39;t have made a better choice.  The main lobby is impressive and part way through our stay the easter eggs made their impressive appearance for the next few weeks.  Dumbo on a Marbled egg is simply amazing!We arrived by Uber this year and we were, as typical for the Deluxe Resorts, greeted immediately by name and handed off to a cast member that would help with the check-in process.  We were staying on the &quot;club level&quot; which we have always done (in anyone wants to know why, ping me...  it is a HUGE benefit when executed properly).  We were there early, so our luggage was handled and we were brought directly to the Club building where we could start our day and informed that when our room was ready, we would be notified by text and through the Disney app. The family split up to pools, and monorail rides to enjoy Disney.  And fairly early in the afternoon, our room was ready.  The rooms are a bit larger in Grand Floridian than they are in some of the other resorts and they make good use of that space.  Two queen beds and a single pullout bed made life easy for us.  Later that evening, we were planning to head out to watch the fireworks from the grounds but realized we could stand on our balcony and have a clear view which was great!  There are better views for sure, but you can&#39;t beat getting back into your room at 9:33 pm literally seconds after the fireworks end.Access to transportation is great with so many options from this resort.  Monorail, boat or bus (or the Minnie-Van&#39;s ;) ) to get you to where you need to go.  I&#39;m not sure if we were just lucky this year, but we never waited more than 5 minutes for any type of transportation.  We used all of the pools during our stay and although crowded, we always (eventually) found a spot to sit back and relax.  Virgin Strawberry Daiquiris were a hit (and a snack credit!!).  The pools were clean and well managed to say the least and the constant activities available at the smaller pool was so much fun to watch. The &quot;Club Level&quot; at Grand Floridian was without question the best of any that we have experienced.  Although a bit smaller than some, the quality of the options was amazing.  Even Mickey waffles in the mornings for those looking for a bit heartier start to the day.  There is rarely anything but raves regarding the staff at the Deluxe resorts and this stay was no different if not a step up.  I&#39;m not sure if there is a process or approach to who goes where but everyone was awesome!There are plenty of shops in the resort to keep you in whatever you need and regardless, spend some time just enjoying the main lobby while you are there.  The restaurant count is greater than any other resort (I think) although some on the high end of the range, but certainly options for everyone. We ended our stay with a trip back to the airport on Disney&#39;s Magical Express and as has been with every time using this service, it was flawless!  A great Disney Resort that deserves its reputation!

This stay we were in the Main Building Club Level. The resort&#39;s attention to detail is extraordinary. Our room was clean and spacious with a wonderful view of Magic Kingdom. The staff was very accommodating during the stay. There is a fitness center and spa on property, and the location on the monorail makes it very convenient.

We have always wanted to stay at Grand Floridian and this time we finally were able to.  The Grand Floridian was very clean and we were able to get a great nights rest thanks to the very comfortable beds.  My children loved the hidden murphy bed so much they traded out each night on who would sleep on it.  We loved that upon our arrival we went down to the dock to watch the fireworks from Magic Kingdom and we could even hear all the music from speakers on the dock.  We can not be more happy about out stay here.

We had a blast! The hotel itself is stunning.  Grounds well kept, impressive lobby and very nice rooms.  The resort is spread out which is nice as there is not a ton of people you come across trying to get to your room from the lobby or pool area.  This is a nice escape from the hectic crowds you face at the parks.  One of the biggest pluses for this resort is the close proximity to Magic Kingdom.  The monorail makes getting around Epcot and Magic Kingdom a breeze.  It also makes bus lines less hectic to the other parks because many people are using the monorail to get to those monorail  parks!  1800 Park Fare was a lovely character dinner for my daughter.  The characters engaged with her really well even though she was quite shy.  My one piece of advise is that the pool areas need more chairs.  There were several occasions that there were no seats available and we needed a pool attendant to assist us (which they did).  Overall, this will likely become our go to Disney hotel!

It is on the disney resort with a hodgepodge of style. Old , new, beach, or lake not sure this place has its nitch. The food is why I knocked the stars down. The food is ok to say the least. As a first time visitor I was not wowed. You are not getting your bang for your buck. Open your wallet and throw your money out the window and make sure you get something to eat before you open your wallet.</code></pre>
<p>Now we can plot the share each rating category (1-5) over time.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rdf %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x=stay_date))+geom_bar(aes(fill=rating))+scale_x_yearmon(format = &quot;%b-%y&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-04-26-grand-floridian-hotel-reviews_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /> It seems like most reviews have been consistenly positive. It also appears that not many reviews were given in early 2015. Though it is possible that the resort had fewer people stay during this time (e.g. renovations/construction), it is more likely that this data is missing. However, we can still analyze the distribution of reviews that we do have. For example, what is the total distribution of each rating category?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#set color

We remove stop words and filter unwanted characters. Then, we can visualize the most common words in the text of all reviews.</p>

<p>We can also visualize the most common “bigrams” (i.e. group of two words). To do this, we first separate the unnested bigram and filter for stop words. Then we put them back together and count the frequency of appearance.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>##bigram: separate--&gt;filter out stop words; put back together--&gt;count
bigram_filt&lt;-rdf %&gt;% 
  unnest_tokens(bigram, review, token = &quot;ngrams&quot;, n = 2) %&gt;%

  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)

  ggplot(aes(x=bigram,y=n))+ geom_segment(aes(x=bigram ,xend=bigram, y=0, yend=n),color=&quot;black&quot;) +
  geom_point(size=3, color=&quot;deepskyblue&quot;)+
  labs(title = &quot;Top 25 Most Common Bigrams in Review Text&quot;, y = &quot;# times used&quot;, x=&quot;&quot;) + coord_flip()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-04-26-grand-floridian-hotel-reviews_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /> Some of the bigram results are particularly interesting, such as “1900 park” (the on-site restaraunt) and “sugar load” (the name of the club level). It also makes sense that “Magic Kingdom” (located right next to the GF) is the most commonly used.</p>
<p>The tidytext package has several lexicons (stored as “sentiments”) that can be used for sentiment analysis. Below, we explore the number of distint words in each lexicon. We exclude “loughran”, the finance lexicon.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sentiment_lexicons &lt;- sentiments %&gt;%

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We have stayed throughout the Deluxe resorts on Disney property.  We are a Disney family and have &quot;grown up&quot; in our accommodation needs starting at Animal Kingdom, through the Epcot resorts and this year, our first year staying at the Grand Floridian. With older kids, we decided to make this our home for our stay this year and we couldn&#39;t have made a better choice.  The main lobby is impressive and part way through our stay the easter eggs made their impressive appearance for the next few weeks.  Dumbo on a Marbled egg is simply amazing!We arrived by Uber this year and we were, as typical for the Deluxe Resorts, greeted immediately by name and handed off to a cast member that would help with the check-in process.  We were staying on the &quot;club level&quot; which we have always done (in anyone wants to know why, ping me...  it is a HUGE benefit when executed properly).  We were there early, so our luggage was handled and we were brought directly to the Club building where we could start our day and informed that when our room was ready, we would be notified by text and through the Disney app. The family split up to pools, and monorail rides to enjoy Disney.  And fairly early in the afternoon, our room was ready.  The rooms are a bit larger in Grand Floridian than they are in some of the other resorts and they make good use of that space.  Two queen beds and a single pullout bed made life easy for us.  Later that evening, we were planning to head out to watch the fireworks from the grounds but realized we could stand on our balcony and have a clear view which was great!  There are better views for sure, but you can&#39;t beat getting back into your room at 9:33 pm literally seconds after the fireworks end.Access to transportation is great with so many options from this resort.  Monorail, boat or bus (or the Minnie-Van&#39;s ;) ) to get you to where you need to go.  I&#39;m not sure if we were just lucky this year, but we never waited more than 5 minutes for any type of transportation.  We used all of the pools during our stay and although crowded, we always (eventually) found a spot to sit back and relax.  Virgin Strawberry Daiquiris were a hit (and a snack credit!!).  The pools were clean and well managed to say the least and the constant activities available at the smaller pool was so much fun to watch. The &quot;Club Level&quot; at Grand Floridian was without question the best of any that we have experienced.  Although a bit smaller than some, the quality of the options was amazing.  Even Mickey waffles in the mornings for those looking for a bit heartier start to the day.  There is rarely anything but raves regarding the staff at the Deluxe resorts and this stay was no different if not a step up.  I&#39;m not sure if there is a process or approach to who goes where but everyone was awesome!There are plenty of shops in the resort to keep you in whatever you need and regardless, spend some time just enjoying the main lobby while you are there.  The restaurant count is greater than any other resort (I think) although some on the high end of the range, but certainly options for everyone. We ended our stay with a trip back to the airport on Disney&#39;s Magical Express and as has been with every time using this service, it was flawless!  A great Disney Resort that deserves its reputation!

This stay we were in the Main Building Club Level. The resort&#39;s attention to detail is extraordinary. Our room was clean and spacious with a wonderful view of Magic Kingdom. The staff was very accommodating during the stay. There is a fitness center and spa on property, and the location on the monorail makes it very convenient.

We have always wanted to stay at Grand Floridian and this time we finally were able to.  The Grand Floridian was very clean and we were able to get a great nights rest thanks to the very comfortable beds.  My children loved the hidden murphy bed so much they traded out each night on who would sleep on it.  We loved that upon our arrival we went down to the dock to watch the fireworks from Magic Kingdom and we could even hear all the music from speakers on the dock.  We can not be more happy about out stay here.

experience staying at The Grand Floridian with my husband and almost two year old.  We had a blast! The hotel itself is stunning.  Grounds well kept, impressive lobby and very nice rooms.  The resort is spread out which is nice as there is not a ton of people you come across trying to get to your room from the lobby or pool area.  This is a nice escape from the hectic crowds you face at the parks.  One of the biggest pluses for this resort is the close proximity to Magic Kingdom.  The monorail makes getting around Epcot and Magic Kingdom a breeze.  It also makes bus lines less hectic to the other parks because many people are using the monorail to get to those monorail  parks!  1800 Park Fare was a lovely character dinner for my daughter.  The characters engaged with her really well even though she was quite shy.  My one piece of advise is that the pool areas need more chairs.  There were several occasions that there were no seats available and we needed a pool attendant to assist us (which they did).  Overall, this will likely become our go to Disney hotel!

## 6 My wife and I recently spent five nights at the Grand Floridian, and we had a great stay. Although we usually visit Walt Disney World with a larger group and a packed itinerary, we planned this trip for just the two of us, intentionally designed to be restful and relaxing. A big focus of the trip was spending time at the resort, and the Grand Floridian was the perfect place to achieve this goal.This was our second time staying at the Grand Floridian, after many stays at other Disney resorts over the years. Our last stay at the Grand Floridian (split between the main hotel and the Grand Floridian Villas) was just last year, when we got married at the Wedding Pavilion on the property. Although we were generally happy with our stay that time, especially in the Villas, we had some issues with unexpected construction on the balcony of our room in the Main Building, which caused a manager to offer us a complimentary night in the Main Building in the future. This trip was our chance to use that night, which we combined with four additional paid nights in the same room. It turned out that virtually all complaints we had on our previous trip were fixed this time, solidifying the Grand Floridian as our favorite of the Disney resorts.Arrival Experience:We completed online check-in and ordered our MagicBands prior to our arrival, which I highly recommend doing so that you can bypass the front desk and save time. You’ll receive a text message with your room number when it’s ready, and your MagicBand serves as your room key to go directly there (a keyless entry feature offered through the My Disney Experience app also now allows your cell phone to serve as a room key using Bluetooth). I expected to get a text message with our room number around the normal check-in time in the afternoon, but I was a little surprised not to have received anything by the time our flight landed in Orlando around 8:30 pm. It was only right before we pulled up to the resort on the Magical Express bus that I received a text with our room number, which made it pretty clear that the system only provided the information when it knew we were close to the property. Although everything worked out fine and we were able to go straight to our room when we arrived, I would have preferred to get the alert as soon as the room was actually ready, even if it was earlier in the day before we were even in Florida. It’s nice to have peace of mind knowing that your room is ready.We used the complimentary Magical Express bus transportation from the airport to the resort, a decision we’ve been regretting on recent trips, but usually end up doing anyway. We never use Magical Express to return to the airport at the end of a trip, since it picks up guests way too early with no flexibility to choose the departure time.Although the ride itself on Magical Express was fine, it seemed to take too long to get to the resort, considering that we didn’t arrive at the Grand Floridian until 90 minutes after getting on the bus at the airport, including at least 30 minutes spent just sitting on the bus waiting to leave.  We also made three stops before reaching the Grand Floridian. We first stopped at Wilderness Lodge, Bay Lake Tower, and then the Contemporary. Even though all of those resorts are in Disney’s Deluxe category, it annoyed me a bit that the Grand Floridian wasn’t the first stop, given that I’ve been told the drivers have discretion to choose their route. I would expect we would be the first stop, not only because the Grand Floridian is Disney’s flagship resort, but also because all of the people who had been waiting on the bus the longest to leave the airport were those going to the Grand Floridian.Hotel Room:Navigating the different room types at the Grand Floridian can be confusing, but the options start with standard rooms with various views, which can be located in four of the buildings on the property (Sago Key, Boca Chica, Big Pine Key, and Conch Key), with the next upgrade being to stay in Sugarloaf Key, another building that includes its own club lounge. The most expensive rooms are generally those in the Main Building, with its own Royal Palm Club on the 4th floor overlooking the main lobby. Guests of one club building (Main Building or Sugarloaf) do not have access to the other club.We were in a King Deluxe Room in the Main Building on this trip. We’ve learned that almost all of the rooms of this type are hidden in a small hallway on the 2nd floor, which is a bit hard to access and feels isolated. Unlike the 3rd-5th floors of the Main Building, which are easy to access directly from the lobby, and are all connected with an internal staircase by the lounge, the 2nd floor alcove where King Deluxe Rooms are located is only accessible by going to the 3rd, 4th, or 5th floor first, walking down the hallway past most of the rooms, and then taking another internal elevator down to the 2nd floor. Given that the elevators are incredibly slow, the trek to the King Deluxe Rooms using two elevators can wear thin.The elevator that goes to the 2nd floor rooms also does continue down to the ground floor, and lets you exit right next to Gasparilla Grill, making it easy enough to leave the building. However, the door right there to get back into the building is inexplicably locked, even to guests staying in that section, so there’s no quick way to get back to your room. I believe some of the King Deluxe Rooms are also located in the corners of the 3rd-5th floors of the Main Building, which might be nice for a more convenient location relative to the lobby and Royal Palm Club, but losing the great view of the Magic Kingdom that comes from the 2nd floor rooms’ location.  We ended up in a room just two doors down from the one we had last time. The room (4204) was definitely nice, but as we saw last time, not as impressive as one might expect at the Grand Floridian. It’s clear the rooms were renovated at some point, but it doesn’t seem to have been overly recently, and the décor is sort of tepidly attempting to the follow the hotel’s Victorian theme. The rooms are nice, and they are a good size, but are really no better than what you find at the other Disney Deluxe Resorts, and certainly not at the level of what you’d expect at a luxury hotel like the nearby Four Seasons, which is at a similar price point. However, I still think that it’s worth it to stay here, because you’re immersed in a Disney experience that I find very well executed. The aspects of the resort outside of the room are what draw us there.We found the room to be quiet (probably largely because it was in the hidden 2nd floor alcove of only nine rooms, all with king beds and fewer kids), with plenty of room to spread out, lots of outlets and USB plugs, and a decent number of drawers to unpack. I thought we might hear noise from Gasparilla Grill, which was directly below our room, but we never heard a thing.The bed was relatively comfortable, although I thought the pillows and bedding left a bit to be desired. For a hotel that’s meant to be upscale, the small, cheap pillows and really thin duvet should be replaced with nicer versions you’d find in a hotel of a similar price point outside of Disney World.The bathrooms in the rooms at the Grand Floridian are another thing that are definitely disappointing, but we knew to expect this from our last stay. The tub/shower and toilet are in a small room together, with the dual sink vanity just outside, generally providing a functional setup for getting ready. However, the bathrooms are just so dated. The tub/shower was by far the oldest one I have seen in a hotel in years. I honestly don’t think the tub itself, which had ancient looking jets in it, had been replaced since the hotel was first built in the 1980s. Despite its age, I appreciated that the bathroom was always very clean and well stocked, with more than enough towels and a hamper provided to hold the dirty towels. It also had an array of toiletries that many Disney resorts don&#39;t include, like aloe, sunblock, and foot scrub.The balcony was something we were really looking forward to, since the inability to use our balcony was the reason we were given a complimentary night during our last stay. This time, we really could enjoy the great straight-on view of Cinderella Castle from our room. We loved taking in the view, and sunrise with the castle in the background was a highlight. It was also just great to sit out there and read or relax, watching the boats and monorail go by. We could always hear the Victorian-themed music that is played on the hotel grounds from our balcony, which was very pleasant.Housekeeping was also very good, always cleaning our room at the right times when we were out, and also doing a nice job with turndown service each evening. There was even a personalized letter left in the room each night, listing any plans or reservations that we had for the next day, which I liked. A simple amenity that I think should be added in the rooms is free bottled water. Even though we could easily grab waters in the club lounge when we walked by, it would have been nice not to have to think about it and just have waters in the room, especially when paying so much to be on one a club floor.Royal Palm Club:We absolutely loved having access to the Royal Palm Club on the 4th floor of the Main Building for the food offerings throughout the day. The thing that impresses me most about the lounge is how generous they are with the quantity of food, and how many different things are available throughout the day. There was always a good array of foods that have a wide appeal to many ages and tastes, in a beautiful setting overlooking the main lobby. The food each day started with breakfast, which featured mostly cold options, like fruit, pastries, bagels, yogurt, croissants, etc., but there were a couple of hot items too, like oatmeal and mini frittatas that were there every day, along with a chef making hot foods on certain days (it was unclear why they had the extra chef station on some days, but not others). One day, the chef was offering Mickey waffles, and the chef option was crepes with s’mores topping another day. We loved starting every morning with breakfast at a table in the lounge overlooking the Grand Floridian grounds and lobby.Next up were afternoon snacks (soups, chips, cheese and charcuterie, cookies), which can definitely serve as a light lunch, followed by afternoon tea, which included the same afternoon snacks, with the addition of warm scones, tea, and a couple small desserts.After that, the evening food started, which was enough to serve as a full dinner if desired. We even cancelled our dinner reservation one night in favor of eating in the lounge instead. They always had at least two hot items at dinner, such as short ribs and chicken skewers one day, along with a hot item meant to appeal to kids, such as macaroni and cheese or chicken tenders. A small bar with complimentary alcoholic beverages was brought out in the evening as well. The selections included a red and a white wine, a sparkling wine, and a variety of beers, with cordials added later in the evening when dessert was out. We were also able to get alcohol earlier in the afternoon, upon request, and we saw others doing the same on a couple occasions. I saw someone request champagne one morning to make a mimosa as well. The final evening desserts in the lounge consisted of a large spread of various mini-desserts and several cookie options to finish out the day. We really enjoyed all of the food that was offered, and thought it was a really nice, crowd pleasing selection. It was a special treat in the late afternoon and evening when the Grand Floridian Society Orchestra and lobby pianist started playing below. Just enjoying the pure relaxation of being on vacation, up in the lounge, listening to the music below, is something that’s hard to replicate. I highly recommend upgrading to the Royal Palm Club if you are interested in having a more luxurious Disney resort experience, and if you expect to spend a good amount of time at the hotel to use the lounge. I was also pleasantly surprised to find the staff at the Royal Palm Club to be wonderful, something that was not the case when we were there last year. The staff members were very friendly and helpful, and really wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. They worked hard replenishing food, clearing tables, and interacting with guests in between. The best cast member in the lounge was Maria from Trinidad, who worked in the evenings. She was so lively and fun, and remembered my wife and I, as well as our drink preferences, from day to day. She’s a true asset to the team and a great ambassador for Disney who makes us want to come back to the Royal Palm Club again.We didn’t use the concierge services of the club level, since we had already planned everything well in advance, but there are two concierge desks on the 3rd floor that are accessible just to Royal Palm Club guests. I recall receiving an email or call before our trip last year to let us know that we could contact the staff to get complimentary planning assistance, but I didn’t receive anything about it this time.Hotel Amenities:Although we spent a lot of time at the resort on this trip, we didn’t use too many hotel amenities other than the Royal Palm Club. Enjoying the pianist or the band playing in the lobby is always a highlight for us, as well as any time spent enjoying the well-maintained grounds.The resort has two pools and a kids’ water play area. We considered visiting the pool one afternoon, but even the quieter pool looked too crowded and rowdy for our taste.There is also a marina with various boats for rent, and a gym and spa near the Villas. The hotel’s walking paths continue past the Wedding Pavilion to the Polynesian Village Resort, so it’s great that you can also easily walk over there, even as far as the Transportation Center. We took a walk from the Transportation Center back to the Grand Floridian one night when we were tired of dealing with the monorail, and it was a pleasant walk of about a mile. There are some nighttime activities, such as outdoor movies on the lawn near the pool, and you can watch the Electrical Water Pageant light show in the lake each evening, in addition to catching glimpses of the Magic Kingdom fireworks.Dining:We’ve tried almost all of the dining options at the Grand Floridian over the course of our various Disney World trips, and we think the dining options are quite good overall. On this trip, we dined at Victoria &amp; Albert’s for the first time, which is the fine dining five-star restaurant on the second floor of the Main Building. I was lucky enough to reserve the exclusive Chef’s Table in the kitchen six months in advance. It was an amazing culinary experience, with attentive service from our husband and wife server team, Jack &amp; Sherry, a long list of delicious and inventive courses, and excellent wine pairings. Our dinner was five hours long, making it a leisurely and exciting dinner experience. I would love to return sometime, and try each of the other rooms in the restaurant that offer slightly different experiences. We felt that dinner at Victoria &amp; Albert’s was well worth the high cost and was a highlight of our trip.The two next best restaurants at Grand Floridian are Citricos (in the Main Building next to Victoria &amp; Albert’s) and Narcoossee’s (on the water by the lake). We’ve tried both on previous trips and are definitely partial to Citricos, which we thought had better food and a more refined feel than the similarly priced Narcoossee’s.On the lobby level, there is also the casual Grand Floridian Café, the 1900 Park Fare character buffet, and the Garden View Tea Room for afternoon tea. There is a lobby bar on the second level, Mizner’s Lounge, right behind where the band plays in the evenings. We’ve never tried the lounge, but have had pretty good experiences at all of the rest of the dining locations in the Main Building on past trips. The final option for food is the quick service location, Gasparilla Island Grill, which is also in the Main Building, but accessible only from the exterior near the marina. We only stopped in for snacks one time this trip, but appreciate that it’s open 24 hours a day and seems to have a pretty varied menu. Transportation:We generally relied on the complimentary Disney transportation anytime we were going to one of the parks, and chose to use Uber or Lyft anytime we were going to another resort that would require a transfer on Disney transportation. For getting to the Magic Kingdom, the Grand Floridian has the best possible location, since it’s the final stop on the resort monorail line before the park. You can be in the Magic Kingdom in no more than 10-15 minutes from catching the monorail off of the second floor of the lobby.Coming back from the Magic Kingdom, especially at busy times, is much more of a pain. The resort monorail coming back seems to take forever, with slow stops at the Contemporary, Transportation Center, and Polynesian, before finally reaching the Grand Floridian. By monorail, it easily can take 30+ minutes to get back to the Grand Floridian from the Magic Kingdom. We also used the boat to return from the Magic Kingdom on one occasion, since it goes directly to the Grand Floridian from the park. However, the boats are very small, and don’t come all that frequently. If you time it right and can get on the first boat that comes, the boat is faster than the monorail. If not, it’s not necessarily a time saver. The boat is generally not worth using on the way to the Magic Kingdom, since it makes a stop at the Polynesian before going to the park in that direction.When traveling to Epcot on the monorail, I would budget at least 45-60 minutes from the Grand Floridian, between the slow ride on the resort monorail to the Transportation Center, and then the process of transferring and waiting for an Epcot monorail from there. When we wanted to visit World Showcase in Epcot in particular, we found it quicker and easier to take an Uber to the Beach Club and just walk in through the back entrance of the park.The buses were generally pretty efficient for Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom, and the My Disney Experience App now includes a section to let you know when the next bus is estimated to arrive. I would still recommend arriving at the bus stop a few minutes before the time reported in the app, because we ended up missing the bus on one occasion when it came several minutes early and was departing just as we walked up. Despite that one situation, I find that the buses often seem much more efficient than the painfully slow monorail that often just sits at each station for long periods of time without moving.Overall:Overall, we had a great stay at both the Grand Floridian. Even though the resort doesn’t have the modern style of most hotels, it’s lovely because it’s different. The pastel color scheme and Victorian style would look outdated and out of place in many instances, but since it’s the theme of the resort, it works well. You feel like you’re stepping into a bygone era the minute you enter the lobby, see all the fresh flowers, and take in the lovely scent.Despite being slightly dated, we liked our room in the Main Building, which was comfortable and large, with the convenience of being part of the Royal Palm Club. The lounge had wonderful food options and was a great place to relax and enjoy quiet time outside the parks. The staff in the Club was really nice, and I generally found staff around the property to be pleasant and helpful, making sure to say hello to guests passing by.We think the Grand Floridian is absolutely the nicest hotel on Disney property, and we will definitely be back in the future. It’s a place where Disney has created a really unique and lovely experience for its guests.
