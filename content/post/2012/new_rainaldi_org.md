Well, as part of my cleanup and organization project with my domain names I decided to keep Rainaldi.org as my resume and technology blog. I will blog about things that I work with as well as new technologies.

Having been in the computer industry professionally for over 15 years now, I have been involved in projects covering various aspects of technology throughout several industries. I have benefited from this depth by gaining a strong knowledge of solution design and business practices from some of the best people in the industry and expanding my knowledge set to handling many different situations.

I am a development manager, I manage other developers and also make recommendations on technology to the company I am employed with. I program in VB, VB.NET, C#, Java, PHP, TSQL and JavaScript. I work daily with MS SQL Server and develop ways of integration of systems in our core products. I do a lot of architecture work, designing architectures that are scalable, efficient and re-usable.

I do a lot of work with Web Services and communications between disparate systems. I have developed solutions
that integration AS/400 to MS SQL Server as well as live integrated solutions that must stay in sync 24x7.
