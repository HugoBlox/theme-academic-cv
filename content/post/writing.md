Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.

**Highlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.**

On this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.

## Examples

### Code

Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the `highlight` option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    data.head()
    ```

renders as

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
data.head()
```

### Math

Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the `math` option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file or by adding `math: true` to your page front matter.

Note that math blocks should be wrapped with `<div>...</div>` and inline math wrapped with `<span>...</span>` as otherwise your math will be parsed as Markdown.

```html
<div>$$
\gamma_{n} = \frac{ 
\left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T 
\left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}
{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}
$$</div>
```

renders as

<div>
$$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}$$
</div>

Or inline math like *\`$\gamma_{n} = \frac{\mathbf x_{n}}{y}$\`* renders as `$\gamma_{n} = \frac{\mathbf x_{n}}{y}$`.

### Diagrams

Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the `diagram` option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file or by adding `diagram: true` to your page front matter.

An example **flowchart**:

    ```mermaid
    graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
    ```

renders as

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A-->B;
  A-->C;
  B-->D;
  C-->D;
```

An example **sequence diagram**:

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
      participant Alice
      participant Bob
      Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
      loop Healthcheck
          John->John: Fight against hypochondria
      end
      Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail...
      John-->Alice: Great!
      John->Bob: How about you?
      Bob-->John: Jolly good!
    ```

renders as

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Alice
  participant Bob
  Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
  loop Healthcheck
      John->John: Fight against hypochondria
  end
  Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail...
  John-->Alice: Great!
  John->Bob: How about you?
  Bob-->John: Jolly good!
```

An example **Gantt diagram**:

    ```mermaid
    gantt
      dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
      section Section
      A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
      Another task     :after a1  , 20d
      section Another
      Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d
      another task      : 24d
    ```

renders as

```mermaid
gantt
  dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
  section Section
  A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
  Another task     :after a1  , 20d
  section Another
  Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d
  another task      : 24d
```

### Todo lists

You can even write your todo lists in Academic too:

```markdown
- [x] Write math example
- [x] Write diagram example
- [ ] Do something else
```

renders as

- [x] Write math example
- [x] Write diagram example
- [ ] Do something else
