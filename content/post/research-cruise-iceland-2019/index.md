The goal of this cruise was to deploy three moorings in the Iceland Basin, the part of the North Atlantic south of Iceland. Weather conditions here can be rough which was one of the reasons for picking this region for NISKINe: Strong, changing winds force a strong near-inertial wave field in the ocean. Nevertheless, for our mooring deployment cruise we were hoping for calm conditions to get the moorings safely in the water. Except for a storm delaying our departure in Iceland we had calm and nice conditions and the moorings went in the water smoothly.
