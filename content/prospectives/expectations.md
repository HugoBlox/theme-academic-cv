### What to expect?

Of course, I can't tell you what life will be like if you join the lab. However, it's good to have some ground rules. You can expect that all lab members (myself included) will uphold these expectations of one another:

* Approach work with curiosity, rigor, and humility. Being a member of the lab is our job, and we take our jobs seriously. It's also *just* a job.
* Value each others' time.
* Trust intent, own impact: gives others the benefit of the doubt, but own the consequences of our behaviors.
* Be an active and collaborative member of the lab. On the flip side, provide feedback with empathy.

In addition, I have some extra responsibilies as your mentor:

* Adjust my mentorship for your career goals (which I should periodically check in about) and career stage.
* Collaborate in the development and execution of a research project.
* Provide feedback on what you are doing well and what skills we can work together on further developing.
* Ensure adequate financial support (including extras such as conferences, computers, publication fees).
