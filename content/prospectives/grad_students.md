## **Graduate students**

{{% alert note %}} 
I am looking to accept one or two graduate students (MS or PhD) into my lab for Fall, 2021 through the [UC Davis Graduate Group in Ecology (GGE)](https://ecology.ucdavis.edu/admissions). [Waivers for the application fee](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/admissions/admission-requirements/steps-applying) are available for certain applicants (see "Graduate Preparation Program Participants"). I am thrilled to share that GRE scores are no longer required for the GGE. Please get in touch if you're interested in joining the lab! (See advice below.)

I look for graduate students who are excited about studying the ecology and management of marine fisheries, who have strong quantitative and verbal communication skills, and who are committed to being collaborative, supportive, and engaged members of the lab and broader university communities. I am happy to work with students who have taken a variety of paths to get to graduate school, provided you have some experience in both ecology/fisheries and quantitative reasoning. This might mean a background (academic or otherwise) in ecology, fishery science, oceanography, math, statistics, computer science, economics, etc.  If you are interested in joining the lab, please contact me with:

1. A brief note on why you are interested in graduate school in general and my research in particular
2. A technical writing sample (e.g., publication, senior thesis, fellowship application, term paper you're really proud of)
3. Your resume/CV and transcripts

Note that I do not maintain a field research program. If you are interested in pursuing fieldwork as part of your thesis/dissertation, I am happy to coadvise.

Your salary as a graduate student will generally be paid by TAships, my grant funding, or fellowships you obtain. Here are some fellowships that might be good fits for students in my lab:

* [UC Davis NSF Research Traineeship in Sustainable Oceans](https://sustainableoceans.ucdavis.edu/) (Great opportunity at Davis!)
* [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)
* [Davidson fellowships](https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/research/davidson-fellowship.html)
* [NOAA-Sea Grant Population and Ecosystem Dynamics](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/NMFS-SG-Fellowship)
* [Nancy Foster Scholarship](https://fosterscholars.noaa.gov/) (Targets women and minorities)
* [Ford Foundation Fellows](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171962) (Open to certain non-citizens, including DACA recipients)
