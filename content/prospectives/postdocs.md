### Postdocs

I have some limited funding for potential postdocs to join the lab. As with graduate students, I'm excited to work with people who are motivated to study the ecology and management of marine fisheries, who have strong quantitative and verbal communication skills, and who are committed to being collaborative, supportive, and engaged members of the community. I'm also happy to collaborate on a postdoctoral fellowship proposal. Please contact me if you're interested in scoping a project together and we can look for potential funding sources.
