<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px;">I was trying to use "<strong>Remote Desktop Connection</strong>" to connect to work place via <strong>VPN</strong>, because it is a lot quicker/smoother then using VNC client. Unfortunately, I cannot find the program under "<strong>Start</strong>" -> "<strong>All Program</strong>" -> "<strong>Accessories</strong>" from my WinXP Home edition laptop. Then, I was recommended to download the third party software. = (</span>
