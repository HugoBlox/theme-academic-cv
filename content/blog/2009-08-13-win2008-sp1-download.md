I just installed Windows Server 2008 in Virtual PC. Try to install All the service packs to the Server before using the "Windows update".
When I go to <span style="font-weight:bold;">Microsoft Download Centre</span>,

From the URL below:
<http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a4dd31d5-f907-4406-9012-a5c3199ea2b3&displaylang=en>
I saw a message which say:
<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="color:rgb(51,51,255);">[Service Pack 1 is a prerequisite for installing Service Pack 2. Please make sure that your system is running Service Pack 1 before you install Service Pack 2. ]</span></span>, that means the ISO that I download will not include SP1.

Therefore I am searching for Windows Server 2008 SP1 from the Download centre, unfortunately, I could not find any location where I can download <span style="font-weight:bold;">Win2008 SP1</span>.

Finally I have checked the version of my <span style="font-weight:bold;">Windows Server 2008</span> by:
"<span style="font-weight:bold;">Start Menu</span>" -> Right Click "<span style="font-weight:bold;">Computer</span>" -> "<span style="font-weight:bold;">Properties</span>"

Cannot believe that the installed version already contain SP1. I guess when they release Windows Server 2008, they have included SP1 in there already.
