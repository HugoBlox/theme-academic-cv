I have updated the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Link checker </span>Beta 1 to have another feature which allow us to check which links your site/page is linking to and is searchable by crawler.

It is an useful tool to check if you have linked to any pages which you do not intend to link to/ or recommend to the other which could affect your site's reputation. E.g. some <span style="font-weight:bold;">spam sites</span>, may leave comment/message on your site, which has pasted a link to their <span style="font-weight:bold;">spam URL</span>"etc.

To check the Page InLinks:

1. Simply select "<span style="font-weight:bold;">PageLink</span>" on the drop down list which just next to the "<span style="font-weight:bold;">Search</span>" button.
2. Whole site check box: Specifies whether to provide results for the entire site, or just the page referenced by the query.

<span style="color:rgb(255,102,0);font-size:85%;">You can ignore the Omit Link option for this feature.</span>

Hope you find it useful!
