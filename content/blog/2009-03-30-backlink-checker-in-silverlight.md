My second Silverlight application: <span style="font-weight:bold;">BackLink Checker Beta 1</span>.

You can use this application to check if other people has link o your website. It would be quite interesting to know if people are interest on you website, they properly will place a link on their site and recommend it to others. Of course, on the other hand if people think your website is crap, they could also place a link no their site and say..[Not to visit your website â€¦etc.].

Here it is some criteria on this BackLink checker.

1. You should enter full URL of your website (with <span style="font-weight:bold;">HTTP/HTTPS</span>)
2. If you put a URL which contain specific page. Then the BackLink checker will only search for the back link for that particular page.
3. It has 2 setting for you to specific the result.

- <span style="font-weight:bold;">Whole site</span> check box: Specifies whether to provide results for the entire site, or just the page referenced by the query
- <span style="font-weight:bold;">Omit link</span> drop down: If specified, link will not be returned if they are from pages in the same <span style="font-weight:bold;">Domain/Sub-domain</span> as the requested page.

This <span style="font-weight:bold;">BackLink Checker</span> only return the links which is indexed by Yahoo, therefore it may not reflect the actually popularity of your website. Hope this can be improve on <span style="font-weight:bold;">Beta 2</span>. = )

Hope you find it useful.
