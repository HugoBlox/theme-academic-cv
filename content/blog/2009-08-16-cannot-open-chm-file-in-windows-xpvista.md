When I try to open <span style="font-weight:bold;">CHM </span>file on Windows XP or Windows Vista, it always display a message "<span style="color:rgb(51,102,255);font-weight:bold;">Navigation to the Webpage has been canceled.</span>".

Finally I have worked out how to resolve this problem.

Solution:

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Right click</span> on the <span style="font-weight:bold;">.CHM</span> file
Click on "**Properties**"
then choose the "**General**" Tab
At the bottom of that tab, you will see something like

<div>
  Security: "<b>This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer</b>"<br />Click on the "<b>Unblock </b>"button which is beside to this message.<br />Click "<b>OK</b>"<br />You should be able to view that CHM.File now
</div>
