  I serve as a data scientist embedded on the Innovation team, incubating new technologies across Indigo's horizontal business, ranging from finding better strategies for growing crops to monitoring grain in the supply chain after harvest. Working closely with data science, engineering, and product teams, I

  * develop recommendations to agronomists and farmers (e.g., how much fertilizer to apply and when) using statistical machine learning, field experiments, and agronomic knowledge:
  * plan experiments in tens of thousands of acres each year;
  * visualize data for agronomists and growers using Python's ecosystem (plot.ly, pandas, geopandas);
  * calibrate grain quality sensors and statistically assess their performance;
  * strategize how to make agriculture more data-driven, scientific, profitable, and sustainable.
