Welcome to the **Languages, Systems, and Data** group's website!

We are a collection of [CSE](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/) research labs at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/) focused on the intersection of languages, systems, and data research.

Our goal as a new, collaborative group of researchers is to tackle multi-domain problems. From programming languages, distributed systems, data management systems, edge computing, formal methods, solver-aided systems, and security.
