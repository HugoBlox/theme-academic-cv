# About me
I am a scientific associate at the Rotman Research Institute, where my work currently focuses on 
examining perception in healthy older adults and those with cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as evaluating the effects of a mindfulness meditation intervention. 

This website is a work in progress - stay tuned for more information about past and current projects coming up in the near future. Feel free to contact me at any time.
