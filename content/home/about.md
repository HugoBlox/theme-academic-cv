# Biography

Growing up, I've always been surround by some form of tech which is how I stumbled into the career path I am now on. I've always been technically inclined when it came to computers, so when the opportunity arose to do what I love professionally, I took it. My professional career started in 2011, where I was first introduced to basic networking, and from that moment on I was hooked. Ever since then I have had the opportunity to work in multiple areas in the world of IT and Development, but out all those areas, I am a network admin, through and through. I am a lover of Linux, Apple, and all things that involve networking. At this point in my life I have the opportunity to server the Oklahoma Supreme Court and Administrative Office of the Courts as the Network Administrator where I strive to provide the best network possible.
