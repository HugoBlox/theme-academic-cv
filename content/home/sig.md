## Special Interest Groups

> #### What are SIGs? :raised_eyebrow:
#### We're glad you asked! :grin: 
#### SIGs represent major areas of computing, addressing the interests of technical communities that drive innovation. SIGs offer a wealth of conferences, publications and activities focused on specific computing sub-disciplines. They enable members to share expertise, discovery and best practices.

> #### That's great! Which ones do we have at UCF? :thinking:
#### UCF used to have 6 SIGs:
#### - SIGGRAPH (Videogame Programming)
#### - SIGWEB (Web Programming)
#### - SIGAI (Artificial Intelligence / Robotics) presently known as [AI@UCF](https://ucfai.org/)
#### - SIGCSE (Programming Beginners)
#### - SIGBED (Embedded Systems)
#### - SIGW (Women in Tech) presently known as [ACM-W](https://ucfacmw.org/)

> #### What happened to them? :open_mouth: Can I still join one? :monocle_face:

#### A few years ago, most of the SIGs separated from ACM and became their own RSOs at UCF. 

#### As of right now, ACM & ACM-W don't have any SIGs, but we are currently trying to start them up again!

**If you are intersted in leading or joining a SIG, please contact us!** :star_struck:
