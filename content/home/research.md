We work on research topics that range from fundamental ecology and evolution to more applied global ecology and sustainability. In particular, we study the ecological role of body size and how this influences individual to ecosystem processes. We also study the consequences of human population size and how changes in human demand and activities, coupled with environmental change, alter a complex social-ecological systems.
