The quantitative fisheries ecology lab at UC Davis uses cutting edge mathematical models and statistical tools to study the ecology, conservation, and management of marine fisheries. More specifically, we explore population, food web, and community dynamics in exploited marine ecosystems (e.g., Oken et *al.* 2018); evaluate and advance tools for ecosystem-based fisheries management (e.g., Oken & Essington 2016); and develop and test statistical methods in fisheries and ecology (e.g., Oken & Essington 2015). 

In well-monitored and carefully managed fisheries, including those on the U.S. West Coast, managers are generally able to react to changes in population productivity as these changes occur. Today's challenge is to better anticipate changes in productivity, particularly long-term changes as populations move and oceans grow warmer, more acidic and less oxygenated, and to develop management strategies that are robust to these changes and continue providing ecosystem services across a range of possible ecological scenarios. For a sense of past research projects and links to papers, check out the lab's [publications]({{< ref "/pubs/index.md" >}}).
