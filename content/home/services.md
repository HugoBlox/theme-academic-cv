During my PhD, I took part to several comitees and help the community in various ways:

* Writing 3 ***reviews*** (as a subreviewer) for several specialised conferences (ICSR, SPLC) or revue (EMSE journal)&nbsp;;<br/><br/>

* Representing scientifics at the Computer Science ***Faculty Council***&nbsp;;<br/><br/>

* Representing and promoting the Computer Science Faculty at several ***Students Fairs***&nbsp;;<br/><br/>

* Representing scientifics at the ***Section Groups***, the place where students can express themselves to improve the faculty.
