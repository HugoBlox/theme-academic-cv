During my PhD, I took part to several comitees and help the community in various ways:

* ***Reviewing*** (mainly as a subreviewer) for several specialised conferences (ICSR, SPLC) or journals (EMSE)&nbsp;;<br/><br/>

* Acting as a ***Student Volunteer*** for OR 2018 and SPLC 2023&nbsp;;<br/><br/>

* Representing scientifics at the Computer Science ***Faculty Council***&nbsp;;<br/><br/>

* Representing and promoting the Computer Science Faculty at several ***Students Fairs***&nbsp;;<br/><br/>

* Representing scientifics at the ***Section Groups***, the place where students can express themselves to improve the faculty.
