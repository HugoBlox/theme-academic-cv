I am a founding member of Northwestern Women in Statistics (WIST) group. In March 2019, I served as a primary organizer of the Women in Data Science ([WiDS](https://www.widsconference.org/)) regional event for Evanston/Chicago. 

In Chicago, I have shared my passion for long-distance running as a coach for [Girls on the Run-Chicago](https://www.gotrchicago.org/).
