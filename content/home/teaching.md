I am responsible for [Social Data Science](https://abjer.github.io/sds) and [Topics in Social Data Science](https://github.com/abjer/tsds/wiki), offered in the Economics department, but available for all social science with a quantitative background. These courses introduce and apply data science methods, incl. applied machine learning, in a social science context. They are Python-based.

Earlier, I have taught Political Economics, Public Expenditure Policy, and Advanced Undergraduate Micro, as well as seminars topics such as Political Economics, Public Economics, and Economics of the Media.

I supervise Master's theses in Social Data Science (incl. applied machine learning), Political Economics, Behavioral Economics, and Public Economics. Please feel free to contact me on thesis topics.
