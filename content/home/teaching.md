I am passionate about undergraduate teaching and mentorship. I currently serve as the graduate assistant chair at the International Studies Residential College ([ISRC](https://isrcnorthwestern.wordpress.com/)), facilitating academic programming and faculty engagement with the undergraduate residents.

I have served as a teaching assistant for courses both at Carnegie Mellon and Northwestern. During my masters year, I participated as a representitive to a Teaching Statistics seminar for graduate students/faculty at CMU to provide guidance on how to structure curricula. I served as a TA for the Experimental Design and Survey, Sampling, and Society course and mentored an undergraduate for her thesis.

At Northwestern, I have been the TA for STAT 202 (Introduction to Statistics), STAT 232, and lectured serveral times.
