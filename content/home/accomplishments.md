  * Analyzed email marketing data – both company and third-party data – to build a model that could predict email responses while reducing the total emails sent by over 50% and presented to company representatives.
  * Identified 15 variables out of 300 in the third-party dataset that resulted in a response rate outside of the average response rate and cleaned the data to create a new dataset for modeling.
  * Built, trained, and compared various models which were used to identify how many emails would need to be sent to retain 80% of responses.
