# Biography
I grew up in Montréal, Québec, after we immigrated there when I was 10 years old from Kiev, Ukraine (big thanks to my family!). 
I became interested in psychology and neuroscience after my favourite college calculus professor
 was waxing lyrical about how the brain is amazing (thank you, Dr. Tom Foxe).
In 2006, I joined the Vision & Cognitive Neuroscience lab at McMaster University as a graduate student, where I 
researched the effects of aging on contour integration and shape
perception with fantastic advisors Dr. Allison Sekuler and Dr. Pat Bennett.
In 2012, I joined the Multisensory Cognition Research Group, headed by Dr. Fiona Newell, at Trinity College Dublin, 
to research multisensory processing and to work on a translational project in collaboration with industry partners, in which we designed and evaluated a video game as an intervention for older adults with a fear of falling.
In 2014, I returned to Montreal to join the Faubert Lab, where my research focused on the effects of aging on attention, distribution of attention in depth, and audiovisual interactions in motion. 
In 2017, I came back to work with Drs. Sekuler and Bennett, concentrating on studies using EEG, as well as working on examining visual and audiovisual perception in older adults with cognitive impairment and dementia, amongst other projects.
