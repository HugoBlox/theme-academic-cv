In the second year of CROSS being a mentor organization for Google Summer of Code, we received Google funding for 4 summer students, Jayjeet Chakraborty (NIT Durgapur, West Bengal, India), Bárbara Galindo Dórame (Universidad de  Sonora, Hermosillo, Mexico), Mohd Arshul Mansoori (Ambedkar Institute  for Advanced Communication Technology & Research, Delhi, India), and Ashay Shirwadkar (UC Riverside). 

The students were mentored by CROSS  incubator fellows Ivo Jimenez and Jeff LeFevre as well as Michael  Sevilla (TidalScale), Noah Watkins (vectorized.io), and Quincy Wofford  (LANL). They did great work and we were able to invite two of the  students to the CROSS Symposium this year and sponsored another one to  visit SC19.
