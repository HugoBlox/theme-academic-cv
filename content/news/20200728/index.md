[Andy Oram](http://praxagora.com/) interviewed me the other day about CROSS and its successes and opportunities. The result is now [published](https://www.lpi.org/blog/2020/07/28/value-open-source-universities-uc-santa-cruz-tests-water) on the blog of the [Linux Professional Institute](https://www.lpi.org/about-lpi/our-purpose), a non-profit, vendor-neutral global certification body for open source professionals.
