CROSS is  honored to be a mentor organization for two of the 2018 Google Summer of Code (GSoC) students. GSoC selected 1,264 students from 64 different  countries working with over 200 open source projects. 

The two CROSS projects are:

**Title**: Archiving with Popper CLI  
**GSoC Student**: Ankan Poddar (National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, West Bengal, India)  
**Mentors**: Ivo Jimenez, Michael Sevilla  
**Abstract**:  The project involves the implementation of a popper sub-command archive  to create an online archive (snapshot) of the repository at any point of time and optionally generate a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Zenodo, Figshare, Open Science Framework (OSF) and Dataverse all provide public APIs which can be used to create online archives on these services and  get a DOI.  

**Title**: Zlog Entry Caching & Benchmarking  
**GSoC Student**: Javier Ron (Escuela Superior Polit√©cnica del Litoral - ESPOL, Guayaquil, Ecuador)  
**Mentors**: Noah Watkins, Jeff LeFevre  
**Abstract**: Create a flexible caching service that can function locally on a zlog  client node, while forming the basis for cache management in a proxy  caching server. Finding and building a benchmark tool for ZLog. Run and  report benchmark tests using the ZLog benchmark tool.
