As part of the [SC21 Reproducibility Initiative](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/submit/reproducibility-initiative/) that _Ivo Jimenez_ (Vectorized.io) and I are chairing we were able to establish the new [SC Best Reproducibility Advancement Award](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/program/awards/sc-best-reproducibility-advancement-award/) that recognizes outstanding efforts in improving transparency and reproducibility of methods for high performance computing, storage, networking and analysis. The new SC Award was approved by the SC Steering Committee on August 12, 2021 and will be awarded at future SC conferences beginning at this year's SC21. See [SC Best Reproducibility Advancement Award](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/program/awards/sc-best-reproducibility-advancement-award/) for details.

Special thanks go to SC21 Artifact Description and Artifact Evaluation Appendices Co-Chairs _Tanu Malik_ (DePaul University) and _Anjo Vahldiek-Oberwagner_ (Intel) for authoring the Award abstract and for co-chairing the SC21 Best Reproducibility Advancement Award Co-Chairs selection committee. Special thanks go also to SC21 Technical Progam Chair _Mary Hall_ (University of Utah), SC21 Conference Chair _Bronis de Supinski_ (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), SC21 Conference Vice Chair _Jeffrey Hollingsworth_ (University of Maryland), SC21 Conference Deputy Chair _Candace Culhane_ (Los Alamos National Laboratory), and SC Steering Committee Member _Michela Taufer_ (University of Tennessee, Knoxville) for championing this Award. 

One important role of this Award is to streamline the pipeline from SC accepted papers to selecting a paper for the SC Student Cluster Competition's Reproducibility Challenge in the following year. I want to thank Reproducibility Challenge Chair _Le Mai Weakley_ (Indiana University), Journal Special Issue Chair _Stephen Harrell_ (Texas Advanced Computing Center) and Journal Special Issue Vice Chair _Scott A. Michael_ (Indiana University) for their great work and for their input on awardee selection.
