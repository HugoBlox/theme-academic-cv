One of the outcomes of attending [!!Con West](http://bangbangcon.com/west/2019/) was an opportunity to join the 285th podcast of [Embedded.fm](https://www.embedded.fm/): “[A Chicken Getting to the Other Side](https://www.embedded.fm/episodes/285)” to talk about [CROSS](https://cross.ucsc.edu) and its three incubator fellows, [Kate Compton](https://www.galaxykate.com/), [Ivo Jimenez](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~ivo/), and [Jeff LeFevre](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~jlefevre/). If you are wondering about the choice of title, listen to the podcast!

The podcast is created and hosted by Elecia White of “[Making Embedded Systems](http://amzn.to/1XxPvjR)” fame and Chris White who, in addition to being an embedded systems  engineer, did all the editing of this podcast -- which made me sound so  much better than in real life!

I’ve never been on a podcast before. Elecia and Chris did a fantastic job of  preparing me for the episode and for making this a great experience  throughout.
