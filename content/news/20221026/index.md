I'm very proud to have the OSPO UC Santa Cruz play a part of [Baskin Engineering Inclusive Excellence Hub](https://ieh.soe.ucsc.edu/)'s Fellowship for Anti-Racism Research (FARR) by providing mentorship to computational media Ph.D. student Milad Hakimshafaei in his work to expand diverse perceptions in visual design.

>Incubator Fellow and PolyPhy Project Lead {{% mention oelek %}} and {{% mention slieggi %}}, executive director for OSPO and the Center for Research in Open Source Software, Hakimshafaei will develop an interface built off of an existing web-based AI generator that will allow the end user to control the system’s behavior to generate interesting and unique patterns. By studying a broad array of users’ visual design aesthetic preferences, he plans to develop algorithms that better represent the experience of beauty for different people.
