I'm honored to have been selected to chair the [SC21 Reproducibility Initiative](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/submit/reproducibility-initiative/) and to work with Reproducibility Initiative Vice Chair _Ivo Jimenez_ (UC Santa Cruz), Reproducibility Challenge Chair _Le Mai Weakley_ (Indiana University), Artifact Description and Artifact Evaluation Appendices Co-Chairs _Tanu Malik_ (DePaul University) and _Anjo Vahldiek-Oberwanger_ (Intel), Journal Special Issue Chair _Stephen Harrell_ (Texas Advanced Computing Center) and Journal Special Issue Vice Chair _Scott A. Michael_ (Indiana University).

A particular focus of this year's Initiative will be advance Artifact Evaluation.  Based on experience of top tier systems conferences [SOSP'19](https://sosp19.rcs.uwaterloo.ca/) and [OSDI'20](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20), authors of accepted papers will be able to apply for badges certifying public availability of artifacts, artifacts passing review, and artifacts reproducing results.

See [here](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/submit/reproducibility-initiative/) for details.
