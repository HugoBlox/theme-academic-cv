I'm retiring my [old website](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~carlosm/UCSC/Home/Home.html) because I won't be able to use iWeb any longer and there are now really nice, open source frameworks available.

Why the switch? I’ve been using [iWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWeb) to maintain this website. Even though Apple discontinued iWeb since 2011, I was able to use it productively, and I always had a million more important things to do than porting my website. Now, Apple’s macOS Catalina doesn’t run 32-bit applications, including iWeb. I considered using a virtual machine to run Mojave -- but the primary reason why I upgrade macOS is increased security. Time to switch.

Luckily, just in time for the holiday season I found a really nice framework based on [Hugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_(software)) and the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/). I love that it’s a static site generator because of it’s responsiveness, flexibility, and easy maintenance -- and it ‘s all open-source. No more dependency on a proprietary 32-bit application. Academic comes with a fantastic publications management system that allows very quick in-browser search and adds publications directly from a bibtex file (via the [academic tool](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-admin)). 

And, perhaps most importantly, others can help me keep it up-to-date because I can share the [source](https://github.com/carlosmalt/academic-kickstart) of the new website via github.
