CROSS Industry-Practitioner-in-Residence Philip Kufeldt contributed to the SNIA Live Webcast on “[Why Composable Infrastructure](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/663/344762/why-composable-infrastructure)”, together with Mike Jochimsen (Kaminario) and hosted by Alex McDonald (NetApp).

The key takeaway for me is that  increasing heterogeneity of components due to the end of Moore’s Law  will make hardware configurations of systems harder, especially for an  increased variety of workloads -- unless these systems are dynamically  reconfigurable or “composable” on the physical level. This will drive  disaggregation which in turn will require components that attach to a  full cross-bar network. In our CROSS research project on “[Eusocial Storage Devices](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~carlosm/UCSC/Research/Entries/2018/7/20_Eusocial_Storage_Devices.html)” we are looking not only at the design of such components but also  considering the fact that those components can communicate among each  other and therefore act collectively in a coordinated fashion.

Don’t miss the excellent [Q&A for this session](http://www.sniacloud.com/composable-infrastructure-qa/).
