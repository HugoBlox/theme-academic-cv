I had the pleasure to be on the [Sustain Podcast](https://sustain.codefund.fm/), talking with [Richard Littauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-littauer-130026138/) and [Justin Dorfman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justindorfman/) about "[How $2 Million Dollars Helped Build CROSS](https://fireside.fm/s/fxw-Bcan+AX3AU4Sm)".
