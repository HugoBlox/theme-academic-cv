On October 3-4, 2018, [the Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS)](https://cross.ucsc.edu/) will host its [3rd Annual Research Symposium](https://cross.ucsc.edu/2018-symposium/) at the Baskin School of Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz.

Check out our [preliminary agenda](https://cross.ucsc.edu/2018-symposium/), including keynotes by [Cat Allman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catallman/) (Google), [AnHai Doan](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/) (Univ. Wisconsin-Madison), [Jay Kreps](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaykreps/) (Confluent).

[Registration is now open](https://cross-registration.soe.ucsc.edu/registration/4) until September 25. The registration fee is $299.

This two-day Symposium will provide an  opportunity to learn about the research and incubator projects at CROSS, interact with CROSS faculty, graduate students, and affiliated  researchers, and discuss future directions and collaborative research  projects at UC Santa Cruz. The program includes plenary sessions with  keynotes and lightening talks, a two-track workshop program, and our  traditional, can't-miss Oktoberfest dinner on the evening of the first  day.

We look forward to seeing you at the Symposium!
