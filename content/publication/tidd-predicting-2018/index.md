abstract: 'Overfishing impacts the three pillars of sustainability: social, ecological
  and economic. Tuna represent a significant part of the global seafood market with
  an annual value exceeding USD$42B and are vulnerable to overfishing. Our understanding
  of how social and economic drivers contribute to overexploitation is not well developed.
  We address this problem by integrating social, ecological and economic indicators
  to help predict changes in exploitation status, namely fishing mortality relative
  to the level that would support the maximum sustainable yield (F/FMSY). To do this
  we examined F/FMSY for 23 stocks exploited by more than 80 states across the worldâ€™s
  oceans. Low-HDI countries were most at risk of overexploitation of the tuna stocks
  we examined and increases in economic and social development were not always associated
  with improved stock status. In the short-term frozen price was a dominant predictor
  of F/FMSY providing a positive link between the market dynamics and the quantity
  of fish landed. Given the dependence on seafood in low-income regions, improved
  measures to safeguard against fisheries overexploitation in the face of global change
  and uncertainty are needed.'
