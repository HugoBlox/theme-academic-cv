abstract: ABSTRACT Here, we propose a novel methodology for replenishment and control
  systems for inventories of two-echelon logistics networks using a two-stage stochastic
  programming, considering periodic review and uncertain demands. In addition, to
  achieve better customer services, we introduce a variable rationing rule to address
  quantities of the item in short. The devised models are reformulated into their
  deterministic equivalent, resulting in nonlinear mixed-integer programming models,
  which are then approximately linearized. To deal with the uncertain nature of the
  item demand levels, we apply a Monte Carlo simulation-based method to generate finite
  and discrete sets of scenarios. Moreover, the proposed approach does not require
  restricted assumptions to the behavior of the probabilistic phenomena, as does several
  existing methods in the literature. Numerical experiments with the proposed approach
  for randomly generated instances of the problem show results with errors around
  1%.
