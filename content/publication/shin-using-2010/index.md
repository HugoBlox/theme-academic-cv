abstract: 'Shin, Y-J., Shannon, L. J., Bundy, A., Coll, M., Aydin, K., Bez, N., Blanchard,

  D., Yemane, D., and Cury, P. M. 2010. Using indicators for evaluating, comparing,
  and communicating the ecological status of exploited marine ecosystems. 2. Setting
  the scene. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 692–716.Background is provided
  to the selection of ecological indicators by the IndiSeas Working Group, and the
  methodology adopted for analysis and comparison of indicators across exploited marine
  ecosystems is documented. The selected indicators are presented, how they are calculated
  is explained, and the philosophy behind the comparative approach is given. The combination
  of selected indicators is intended to reflect different dynamics, tracking processes
  that display differential responses to fishing, and is meant to provide a complementary
  means of assessing marine ecosystem trends and states. IndiSeas relied on inputs
  and insights provided by the local experts from participating ecosystems, helping
  to understand state and trend indicators and to disentangle the effect of other
  potential ecosystem drivers, such as climate variability. This project showed that
  the use of simple and available indicators under an ecosystem approach can achieve
  a real, wide-reaching evaluation of marine ecosystem status caused by fishing. This
  is important because the socio-economics of areas where fishing activities develop
  differs significantly around the globe, and in many countries, insufficient data
  are available for complex and exhaustive analyses.'
