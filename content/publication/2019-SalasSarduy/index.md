abstract: "Enzymes of the M32 family are Zn-dependent
metallocarboxypeptidases (MCPs) widely distributed among prokaryotic
organisms and just a few eukaryotes including Trypanosoma brucei and
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agents of sleeping sickness and Chagas
disease, respectively. These enzymes are absent in humans and several
functions have been proposed for trypanosomatid M32 MCPs. However, no
synthetic inhibitors have been reported so far for these enzymes. Here, we
present the identification of a set of inhibitors for TcMCP-1 and TbMCP-1
(two trypanosomatid M32 enzymes sharing 71% protein sequence identity) from
the GlaxoSmithKline HAT and CHAGAS chemical boxes; two collections grouping
404 compounds with high antiparasitic potency, drug-likeness, structural
diversity and scientific novelty. For this purpose, we adapted continuous
fluorescent enzymatic assays to a medium-throughput format and carried out
the screening of both collections, followed by the construction of
dose-response curves for the most promising hits. As a result, 30
micromolar-range inhibitors were discovered for one or both enzymes. The
best hit, TCMDC-143620, showed sub-micromolar affinity for TcMCP-1,
inhibited TbMCP-1 in the low micromolar range and was inactive against
angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), a potential mammalian off-target
structurally related to M32 MCPs. This is the first inhibitor reported for
this family of MCPs and considering its potency and specificity,
TCMDC-143620 seems to be a promissory starting point to develop more
specific and potent chemical tools targeting M32 MCPs from trypanosomatid
parasites."
