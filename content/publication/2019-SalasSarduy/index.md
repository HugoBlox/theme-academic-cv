abstract: "In recent years, the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline
announced the disclosure of small collections of antiparasitic compounds to
facilitate research and drug development for three of the main Tropical
Neglected Diseases- i.e. Human African Trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis and
Chagas Disease. These collections include new chemical entities with
potential novel mechanisms of action that are likely to be active against a
wide variety of targets. Taking advantage of these open access molecules, we
successfully set up medium-throughput screening assays to find the first
inhibitors of two metallocarboxypeptidases of the M32 family, a group of
proteolytic enzymes proposed to play several roles in the biology of
trypanosomatids including peptide catabolism, maintenance of parasite
adaptive fitness and hydrolysis of bioactive peptides from the human host."
