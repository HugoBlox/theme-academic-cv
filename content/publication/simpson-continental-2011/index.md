abstract: Climate change affects marine biological processes from genetic to ecosystem
  levels [1, 2, 3]. Recent warming in the northeast Atlantic [4, 5] has caused distributional
  shifts in some fish species along latitudinal and depth gradients [6, 7], but such
  changes, as predicted by climate envelope models [8], may often be prevented because
  population movement requires availability of suitable habitat. We assessed the full
  impacts of warming on the commercially important European continental shelf fish
  assemblage using a data-driven Eulerian (grid-based) approach that accommodates
  spatial heterogeneity in ecological and environmental conditions. We analyzed local
  associations of species abundance and community diversity with climatic variables,
  assessing trends in 172 cells from records of textgreater100 million individuals
  sampled over 1.2 million km2 from 1980–2008. We demonstrate responses to warming
  in 72% of common species, with three times more species increasing in abundance
  than declining, and find these trends reflected in international commercial landings.
  Profound reorganization of the relative abundance of species in local communities
  occurred despite decadal stability in the presence-absence of species. Our analysis
  highlights the importance of focusing on changes in species abundance in established
  local communities to assess the full consequences of climate change for commercial
  fisheries and food security.
