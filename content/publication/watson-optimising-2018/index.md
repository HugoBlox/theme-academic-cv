abstract: 'The ability of medium-resolution (10–30 m) satellite imagery to delineate
  the size and persistence of ponds on debris-covered glaciers is a topic of recent
  interest as it has become apparent through the use of fine-resolution products that
  smaller ponds have often been neglected. In this study, we performed a quantitative
  analysis of pond detection using a normalised difference water index (NDWI) applied
  to several widely used satellite sensors, which offer multispectral information
  at high radiometric precision. These data include: RapidEye (5 m spatial resolution),
  Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) (10–20 m), and Landsat 8 Operational Land
  Imager (OLI) multispectral imagery (30 m). We demonstrate a method to derive an
  optimum NDWI value for pond classification using a subset reference dataset of 285
  ponds classified using fine-resolution (0.5 m) imagery. We then applied the optimised
  NDWI (NDWI-O) to the remaining images to assess pond classification accuracy against
  a broader reference dataset of 898 ponds. NDWI values calculated using Sentinel-2
  imagery showed the best spectral contrast between water and surrounding debris cover,
  and the strongest relationship with pixel water content (R2 = 0.56), followed by
  the RapidEye NDWI (R2 = 0.45). We conclude that RapidEye and Sentinel-2 imagery
  is best suited for accurate pond classification using a multispectral classification
  approach, which is important for quantifying their role in glacier ablation, meltwater
  regulation, and lake development. By comparison, the impact of using coarse-resolution
  Landsat 8 imagery to characterise surface water dynamics is minimised when applied
  to large glacier lakes, where the area-to-perimeter ratio is greater.'
