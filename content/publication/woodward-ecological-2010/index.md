abstract: Attempts to gauge the biological impacts of climate change have typically
  focussed on the lower levels of organization (individuals to populations), rather
  than considering more complex multi-species systems, such as entire ecological networks
  (food webs, mutualistic and host-parasitoid networks). We evaluate the possibility
  that a few principal drivers underpin network-level responses to climate change,
  and that these drivers can be studied to develop a more coherent theoretical framework
  than is currently provided by phenomenological approaches. For instance, warming
  will elevate individual ectotherm metabolic rates, and direct and indirect effects
  of changes in atmospheric conditions are expected to alter the stoichiometry of
  interactions between primary consumers and basal resources; these effects are general
  and pervasive, and will permeate through the entire networks that they affect. In
  addition, changes in the density and viscosity of aqueous media could alter interactions
  among very small organisms and disrupt the pycnoclines that currently compartmentalize
  many aquatic networks in time and space. We identify a range of approaches and potential
  model systems that are particularly well suited to network-level studies within
  the context of climate change. We also highlight potentially fruitful areas of research
  with a view to improving our predictive power regarding climate change impacts on
  networks. We focus throughout on mechanistic approaches rooted in first principles
  that demonstrate potential for application across a wide range of taxa and systems.
