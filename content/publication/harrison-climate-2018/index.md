abstract: textlessptextgreatertextlessstrongtextgreaterAbstract.textless/strongtextgreater
  Despite recent research identifying a clear anthropogenic impact on glacier recession,
  the effect of recent climate change on glacier-related hazards is at present unclear.
  Here we present the first global spatio-temporal assessment of glacial lake outburst
  floods (GLOFs) focusing explicitly on lake drainage following moraine dam failure.
  These floods occur as mountain glaciers recede and downwaste. GLOFs can have an
  enormous impact on downstream communities and infrastructure. Our assessment of
  GLOFs associated with the rapid drainage of moraine-dammed lakes provides insights
  into the historical trends of GLOFs and their distributions under current and future
  global climate change. We observe a clear global increase in GLOF frequency and
  their regularity around 1930, which likely represents a lagged response to post-Little
  Ice Age warming. Notably, we also show that GLOF frequency and regularity – rather
  unexpectedly – have declined in recent decades even during a time of rapid glacier
  recession. Although previous studies have suggested that GLOFs will increase in
  response to climate warming and glacier recession, our global results demonstrate
  that this has not yet clearly happened. From an assessment of the timing of climate
  forcing, lag times in glacier recession, lake formation and moraine-dam failure,
  we predict increased GLOF frequencies during the next decades and into the 22nd
  century.textless/ptextgreater
