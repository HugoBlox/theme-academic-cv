abstract: Climate change is driving a pervasive global redistribution of the planet's
  species. Species redistribution poses new questions for the study of ecosystems,
  conservation science and human societies that require a coordinated and integrated
  approach. Here we review recent progress, key gaps and strategic directions in this
  nascent research area, emphasising emerging themes in species redistribution biology,
  the importance of understanding underlying drivers and the need to anticipate novel
  outcomes of changes in species ranges. We highlight that species redistribution
  has manifest implications across multiple temporal and spatial scales and from genes
  to ecosystems. Understanding range shifts from ecological, physiological, genetic
  and biogeographical perspectives is essential for informing changing paradigms in
  conservation science and for designing conservation strategies that incorporate
  changing population connectivity and advance adaptation to climate change. Species
  redistributions present challenges for human well-being, environmental management
  and sustainable development. By synthesising recent approaches, theories and tools,
  our review establishes an interdisciplinary foundation for the development of future
  research on species redistribution. Specifically, we demonstrate how ecological,
  conservation and social research on species redistribution can best be achieved
  by working across disciplinary boundaries to develop and implement solutions to
  climate change challenges. Future studies should therefore integrate existing and
  complementary scientific frameworks while incorporating social science and human-centred
  approaches. Finally, we emphasise that the best science will not be useful unless
  more scientists engage with managers, policy makers and the public to develop responsible
  and socially acceptable options for the global challenges arising from species redistributions.
