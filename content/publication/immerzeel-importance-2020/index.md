abstract: Mountains are the water towers of the world, supplying a substantial part
  of both natural and anthropogenic water demands1,2. They are highly sensitive and
  prone to climate change3,4, yet their importance and vulnerability have not been
  quantified at the global scale. Here we present a global water tower index (WTI),
  which ranks all water towers in terms of their water-supplying role and the downstream
  dependence of ecosystems and society. For each water tower, we assess its vulnerability
  related to water stress, governance, hydropolitical tension and future climatic
  and socio-economic changes. We conclude that the most important (highest WTI) water
  towers are also among the most vulnerable, and that climatic and socio-economic
  changes will affect them profoundly. This could negatively impact 1.9 billion people
  living in (0.3 billion) or directly downstream of (1.6 billion) mountainous areas.
  Immediate action is required to safeguard the future of the world’s most important
  and vulnerable water towers.
