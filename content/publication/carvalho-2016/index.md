abstract: Uncertainty has a significant impact on the stability and performance of
  engineering-to-order (ETO) production systems by affecting due date achievement,
  efficient resource allocation and the usage of nonregular working force. Proactive
  planning approaches consider information about uncertainty to protect the generated
  plans against future disruption. Likewise, this paper´s goal is to propose and apply
  a robust optimization model that addresses a tactical capacity planning problem
  by incorporating uncertainties regarding the duration of production processes. The
  model aims at solution robustness (or stability) and intends to enhance and support
  the decision-making process of a real-world ETO industrial setting. Monte Carlo
  simulation is employed to assess the simultaneous impact of multiple constraints
  on the robustness of the generated solutions. The computational results are adherent
  to the industry setting studied and show the effects of the conservatism level on
  the optimal values of the generated plans. To the best of our knowledge, this is
  the first robust optimization model for tactical capacity planning that explicitly
  addresses the ETO context.
