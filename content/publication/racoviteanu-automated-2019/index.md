abstract: The separation of fresh snow, exposed glacier ice and debris-covered ice
  on glacier surfaces is needed for hydrologic applications and for understanding
  the response of glaciers to climate variability. The end-of-season snowline altitude
  is an indicator of the equilibrium line altitude of a glacier and is often used
  to infer the mass balance of a glacier. Regional snowline estimates are generally
  missing from glacier inventories for remote, high-altitude glacierized areas such
  as High Mountain Asia. In this study, we present an automated, decision-based image
  classification algorithm implemented in Python to separate snow, ice and debris
  surfaces on glaciers and to extract glacier snowlines at monthly and annual time
  steps and regional scales. The method was applied in the Hunza basin in the Karakoram
  and the Trishuli basin in eastern Himalaya. We automatically partitioned the various
  types of surfaces on glaciers at each time step using band ratios combined with
  topographic criteria based on two versions of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
  elevation dataset. Snowline altitudes were extracted on a pixel-by-pixel basis using
  a “buffer” method adapted for each elevation dataset. Over the period studied (2000
  to 2016), end-of-the-ablation season annual ELAs fluctuated from 4,917 m a.s.l.
  to 5,336 m a.s.l. for the Hunza, with a 16-year average of 5,177 ±108 m, and 5,395
  m a.s.l. to 5,565 m a.s.l. for the Trishuli, with an average of 5,444 ± 63 m a.s.l.
  Snowlines were sensitive to the manual corrections of the partition, the topographic
  slope, the elevation dataset and the band ratio thresholds particularly during the
  spring and winter months, and were not sensitive to the size of the buffer used
  to extract the snowlines. With further refinement and calibration with field measurements,
  this method can be easily applied to Sentinel-2 data (5 days temporal resolution)
  as well as daily PlanetScope to derive sub-monthly snowlines.
