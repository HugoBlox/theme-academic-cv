abstract: A Bayesian approach to estimate bias and uncertainty in snowfall precipitation
  from MERRA-2 and other precipitation products was applied over High Mountain Asia
  (HMA), using a newly developed snow reanalysis method. Starting from an ‘uninformed’
  prior probability distribution, a posterior scaling factor applied to MERRA-2 snowfall
  was derived by constraining model-based estimates of seasonal snow accumulation
  and ablation over the water year (WY) with fractional snow covered area (fSCA) measurements
  derived from Landsat and MODIS (MODSCAG). Several sub-domains (nine representative
  1° by 1° tiles) across HMA were examined over the period WYs 2001-2015 and compiled
  into an uncertainty parameterization where a lognormal distribution was fitted to
  the empirical posterior distribution with a mean of 1.54 (median of 1.19) and coefficient
  of variation of 0.83, indicating that MERRA-2 underestimates snowfall on average
  by ~54% with sizeable uncertainty. For reference, the uncertainties in snowfall
  precipitation from the ERA5 and APHRODITE-2 precipitation produces were also evaluated,
  and these products were found to underestimate snowfall, on average by a factor
  around 1.78 and 3.34 (with median scaling factors of 1.42 and 2.51) respectively.
  The results indicate that snowfall precipitation at high-elevations dominated by
  snowfall is underestimated in most existing products, especially in the gauge-based
  APHRODITE-2 product, where the biases were also found to exhibit geographical variations
  with the largest underestimation in monsoon-influenced high-elevation tiles. The
  derived MERRA-2 uncertainty model is being used to develop a full domain-wide HMA
  snow reanalysis, which will shed further light onto the space-time variations in
  snowfall biases in these products.
