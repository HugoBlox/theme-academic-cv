abstract: "As the number and variety of files stored and accessed by a typical user has dramatically increased, existing file system structures have begun to fail as a mechanism for managing all of the information contained in those files. Many applications---email clients, multimedia management applications, and desktop search engines are examples--- have been forced to develop their own richer metadata infrastructures. While effective, these solutions are generally non-standard, non-portable, non-sharable across applications, users or platforms, proprietary, and potentially inefficient. In the interest of providing a rich, efficient, shared file system metadata infrastructure, we have developed the Linking File System (LiFS). Taking advantage of non-volatile storage class memories, LiFS supports a wide variety of user and application metadata needs while efficiently supporting traditional file system operations."
