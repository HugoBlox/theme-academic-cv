abstract: The formation and expansion of Himalayan glacial lakes has implications
  for glacier dynamics, mass balance, and glacial lake outburst floods. Subaerial
  and subaqueous calving is an important component of glacier mass loss but they have
  been difficult to track due to spatio-temporal resolution limitations in remote
  sensing data and few field observations. In this study, we used near-daily 3 m resolution
  PlanetScope imagery in conjunction with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) survey
  to quantify calving events and derive an empirical area-volume relationship to estimate
  calved glacier volume from planimetric iceberg areas. A calving event at Thulagi
  Glacier in 2017 was observed by satellite from before and during the event to nearly
  complete melting of the icebergs, and was observed in situ midway through the melting
  period, thus giving insights into the melting processes. In situ measurements of
  Thulagi Lake’s surface and water column indicate that daytime sunlight absorption
  heats mainly just the top metre of water, but this heat is efficiently mixed downward
  through the top tens of metres due to forced convection by wind-blown icebergs;
  this heat then is retained by the lake and is available to melt the icebergs. Using
  satellite data we assess seasonal glacier velocities, lake thermal regime, and glacier
  surface elevation change for Thulagi, Lower Barun, and Lhotse Shar glaciers and
  their associated lakes. The data reveal widely varying trends, likely signifying
  divergent future evolution. Glacier velocities derived from 1960/70s declassified
  Corona satellite imagery revealed evidence of glacier deceleration for Thulagi and
  Lhotse Shar glaciers, but acceleration at Lower Barun Glacier following lake development.
  We used published modelled ice thickness data to show that upon reaching their maximum
  extents, Imja, Lower Barun, and Thulagi lakes will contain, respectively, about
  90×106 m3, 62×106 m3, and 5×106 m3 of additional water compared to their 2018 volumes.
  Understanding lake–glacier interactions is essential to predict future glacier mass
  loss, lake formation, and associated hazards.
