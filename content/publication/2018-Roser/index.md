# abstract

##abstract = "Background
#Exploration and processing of FASTQ files are the first steps in
#state-of-the-art data analysis workflows of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
#platforms. The large amount of data generated by these technologies has put
#a challenge in terms of rapid analysis and visualization of sequencing
#information. Recent integration of the R data analysis platform with web
#visual frameworks has stimulated the development of user-friendly, powerful,
#and dynamic NGS data analysis applications.
#
#Results
#This paper presents FastqCleaner, a Bioconductor visual application for both
#quality-control (QC) and pre-processing of FASTQ files. The interface shows
#diagnostic information for the input and output data and allows to select a
#series of filtering and trimming operations in an interactive framework.
#FastqCleaner combines the technology of Bioconductor for NGS data analysis
#with the data visualization advantages of a web environment.
#
#Conclusions
#FastqCleaner is an user-friendly, offline-capable tool that enables access
#to advanced Bioconductor infrastructure. The novel concept of a Bioconductor
#interactive application that can be used without the need for programming
#skills, makes FastqCleaner a valuable resource for NGS data analysis."
