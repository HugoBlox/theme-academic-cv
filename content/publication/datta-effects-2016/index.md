abstract: The recent advent of dynamic size spectrum models has allowed the analysis
  of life processes in marine ecosystems to be carried out without the high complexity
  arising from interspecies interactions within dense food webs. In this paper, we
  use “mizer”, a size spectrum modelling framework, to investigate the consequences
  of including the seasonal processes of plankton blooms and batch spawning in the
  model dynamics. A multispecies size spectrum model is constructed using 12 common
  North Sea ﬁsh species, with growth, predation, and mortality explicitly modelled,
  before simulating both seasonal plankton blooms and batch spawning of ﬁsh (using
  empirical data on the spawning patterns of each species). The effect of seasonality
  on the community size spectrum is investigated; it is found that with seasonal processes
  included, the species spectra are more varied over time, while the aggregated community
  spectrum remains fairly similar. Growth of seasonally spawning mature individuals
  drops signiﬁcantly during peak reproduction, although lifetime growth curves follow
  nonseasonal ones closely. On analysing properties of the community spectrum under
  different ﬁshing scenarios, seasonality generally causes more varied spectrum slopes
  and lower yields. Under seasonal conditions, increasing ﬁshing effort also results
  in greater temporal variability of ﬁsheries yields due to truncation of the community
  spectrum towards smaller sizes. Further work is needed to evaluate robustness of
  management strategies in the context of a wider range of seasonal processes and
  behavioural strategies, as well as longer term environmental variability and change.
