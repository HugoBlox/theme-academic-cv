 abstract = {The RUN (Reduction to UNiprocessor) [18, 19, 13] algorithm was first described by Regnier, et al. as a novel and elegant solution to real-time multiprocessor scheduling. The first practical implementation of RUN [3] created by Compagnin, et. al., both verified the simulation results and showed that it can be efficiently implemented on top of standard operating system primitives. While RUN is now the proven best solution for scheduling fixed rate tasks on multiprocessors, it can also be applied to other resources. This technical report briefly describes RUN and how it could be used in any situation involving an array of multiple resources where some form of preemptions and migrations are allowed (although must be minimized). It also describes how buffers can be sanity checked in a system where a RUN-scheduled resource is consuming data from another RUN-scheduled resource.},
