abstract: "Objectives: By juxtaposing literature in signed language interpreting with\
  \ that of spoken language interpreting, we provide a narrative review to explore\
  \ the complexity of emotion management in interpreter-mediated medical encounters.\
  \ Methods: We conduct literature search through library databases and Google Scholar\
  \ using varied combinations of search terms, including interpreter, emotion, culture,\
  \ and health care. Results: We first examine (a) interpreters' management and performance\
  \ of others' emotions, (b) interpreters' management and performance of their own\
  \ emotions, and (c) impacts of emotion work for healthcare interpreters. Conclusion:\
  \ By problematizing the roles and functions of emotion and emotion work in interpreter-mediated\
  \ medical encounters, we propose a normative model to guide future research and\
  \ practices of interpreters' emotion management in cross-cultural care. Practice\
  \ implications: Quality and equality of care should serve as the guiding principle\
  \ for interpreters' decision-making about their emotions and emotion work. Rather\
  \ than adopting a predetermined practice, interpreters should evaluate and prioritize\
  \ the various clinical, interpersonal, and therapeutic objectives as they consider\
  \ the best practice in managing their own and other speakers' emotions. (PsycINFO\
