abstract: "In-car devices that use audio output have been shown to be
less distracting than traditional graphical user interfaces, but
can be cumbersome and slow to use. In this paper, we
report an experiment that demonstrates how these
performance characteristics impact whether people will
elect to use an audio interface in a multitasking situation.
While steering a simulated vehicle, participants had to
locate a source of information in a short passage of text.
The text was presented either on a visual interface, or using
a text-to-speech audio interface. The relative importance of
each task was varied. A no-choice/choice paradigm was
used in which participants first gained experience with each
of the two interfaces, before being given a choice on which
interface to use on later trials. The characteristics of the
interaction with the interfaces, as measured in the no-choice
phase, and the relative importance of each task, had an
impact on which output modality was chosen in the choice
phase. Participants that prioritized the secondary task
tended to select the (faster yet more distracting) visual
interface over the audio interface, and as a result had poorer
lane keeping performance. This work demonstrates how a
userâ€™s task objective will influence modality choices with
multimodal devices in multitask environments."
