abstract: "Software businesses are continuously increasing their cloud presence in the cloud. While cloud computing is not a new research topic, designing software for the cloud still requires engineers to make an investment to become proficient working with it. This paper introduces a pattern language for cloud software development and briefly describes details pattern. Design patterns can help developers validate or design their cloud software. The language is composed by ten patterns novel patterns organizes in three categories: Orchestration and Supervision, Monitoring and Discovery and Communication.
