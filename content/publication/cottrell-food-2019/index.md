abstract: Sudden losses to food production (that is, shocks) and their consequences
  across land and sea pose cumulative threats to global sustainability. We conducted
  an integrated assessment of global production data from crop, livestock, aquaculture
  and fisheries sectors over 53â€‰years to understand how shocks occurring in one food
  sector can create diverse and linked challenges among others. We show that some
  regions are shock hotspots, exposed frequently to shocks across multiple sectors.
  Critically, shock frequency has increased through time on land and sea at a global
  scale. Geopolitical and extreme-weather events were the main shock drivers identified,
  but with considerable differences across sectors. We illustrate how social and ecological
  drivers, influenced by the dynamics of the food system, can spill over multiple
  food sectors and create synchronous challenges or trade-offs among terrestrial and
  aquatic systems. In a more shock-prone and interconnected world, bold food policy
  and social protection mechanisms that help people anticipate, cope with and recover
  from losses will be central to sustainability.
