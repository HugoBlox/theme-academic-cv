abstract: Water stored in the form of snow and glaciers in the High Mountain Asia
  (HMA) region regulates the water supply, and resultant water-based economies, that
  support the livelihoods of about 1.4 billion people. Trends in the seasonal and
  long-term melting of snow and glaciers, governed by initial ice reserves, meteorological
  factors and geographic features, vary across sub-basins in the HKH region. We examined
  the economic impacts of climate-led changes in river flow in two drainage basins,
  one each from the Karakoram and Central Himalaya region. We used an integrated assessment
  framework to estimate the changes in economic value of the hydropower generation
  from hydropower plants on rivers fed by snow and glacier melt in the two sub-basins.
  The framework, developed under a NASA High Mountain Asia project, coupled biophysical
  models (a suite of climate models, snow/glacier-hydrology, and hydropower models)
  with economic analysis. We compared the differences in estimated river flow over
  historic and future time using the water balance model in sixteen scenarios (eight
  climate models and two emissions scenarios) for rivers upstream of hydropower plants
  in each sub-basin. Using the hydropower model, we estimated the changes in hydropower
  generation at the Naltar IV hydropower plant, with an 18 MW capacity, located in
  Hunza, Karakoram, and the Trishuli hydropower plant, with a 19.6 MW capacity, in
  Trishuli, Central Himalaya. When compared to their baselines, the estimated impact
  of climate change and temporal variability were higher for the Naltar plant than
  for the Trishuli plant. Our sensitivity analysis shows that hydropower plants with
  water storage facilities help reduce the impact of changes, but the estimated impacts
  are higher for the higher capacity plants. This study provides an example of the
  differential impacts of climate change on hydropower plants located in rivers fed
  by varying amounts of snow and glacier melt at different decades in this century.
  This type of integrated assessment of climate change impact will support the scientific
  understanding of hydrologic flow and its impacts on a hydropower economy under various
  climate scenarios, as well as generate information about water resource management
  in a changing climate.
