abstract: Mapping and monitoring landslides in remote areas with steep and mountainous
  terrain is logistically challenging, expensive, and time consuming. Yet, in order
  to mitigate hazards and prevent loss of life in these areas, and to better understand
  landslide processes, high-resolution measurements of landslide activity are necessary.
  Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) provides millimeter-scale
  measurements of ground surface deformation that can be used to identify and monitor
  landslides in remote areas where ground-based monitoring techniques are not feasible.
  Here we present a novel InSAR deformation detection approach, which uses double
  difference time-series with local and regional spatial filters and pixel clustering
  methods to identify and monitor slow-moving landslides without making a priori assumptions
  of the location of landslides. We apply our analysis to freely available Copernicus
  Sentinel-1 satellite data acquired between 2014 and 2017 centered on the Trishuli
  River drainage basin in Nepal. We found a minimum of 6 slow-moving landslides that
  all occur within the Ranimatta lithologic formation (phyllites, metasandstones,
  metabasics). These landslides have areas ranging from 0.39 to 1.66 km2 and long-term
  dry-season displacement rates ranging from 2.1 to 8.8 cm/yr. Due to periods of low
  coherence during the monsoon season (June – September) each year, and following
  the 25 April 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake, our time series analysis is limited to
  the 2014–2015 and 2016–2017 dry seasons (September–May). We found that each of the
  landslides displayed slightly higher rates during the 2014 period, likely as a result
  of higher cumulative rainfall that fell during the 2014 monsoon season. Although
  we do not have high quality InSAR data to show the landslide evolution directly
  following the Gorkha earthquake, the similar rates of movement before (2014–2015)
  and after (2016–2017) Gorkha suggest the earthquake had negligible long-term impact
  on these landslides. Our findings highlight the potential for region-wide mapping
  of slow-moving landslides using freely available remote sensing data in remote areas
  such as Nepal and future work will benefit from expanding our methodology to other
  regions around the world.
