abstract: Microfluidic chips and a microrobot using SU-8 and NdFeB magnets were fabricated. A faster healing time can be achieved using our method than conventional scratching. Woundâ€™s geometry and shape can influence healing speed and rate. Permanent magnets were successfully coated by PDA, and characterized by SEM and FT-IR. The cell viability is not adversely affected after microrobotic scratching.
