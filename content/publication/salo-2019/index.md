abstract: Influence diagrams are widely employed to represent multi-stage decision
  problems in which each decision is a choice from a discrete set of alternatives,
  uncertain chance events have discrete outcomes, and prior decisions may influence
  the probability distributions of uncertain chance events endogenously. In this paper,
  we develop the Decision Programming framework which extends the applicability of
  influence diagrams by developing mixed-integer linear programming formulations for
  solving such problems in the presence of many kinds of constraints. In particular,
  Decision Programming makes it possible to (i) solve problems in which earlier decisions
  cannot necessarily be recalled later, for instance, when decisions are taken by
  agents who cannot communicate with each other; (ii) accommodate a broad range of
  deterministic and chance constraints, including those based on resource consumption,
  logical dependencies or risk measures such as Conditional Value-at-Risk; and (iii)
  determine all non-dominated decision strategies in problems which involve multiple
  value objectives. In project portfolio selection problems, Decision Programming
  allows scenario probabilities to depend endogenously on project decisions and can
  thus be viewed as a generalization of Contingent Portfolio Programming.
