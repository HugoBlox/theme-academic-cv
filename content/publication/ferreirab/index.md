abstract: "Every year, thousands ofnew students begin their Masters in STEM-related topics. Despite being regarded as a common occurrence by the faculty, it represents the culmination of years of studying and preparation for their professional life. Notwithstanding, these stu- dents face well-known recurrent problems: how to choose a topic, how to choose an advisor, how to start researching, and how to deal with all the unknowns associated with academic research. Although there are several books on how to write a thesis, most ofthem avoid prescriptive recommendations on topics beyond research per se or focus on doctoral students, for which the duration and motiva- tion are significantly different. In this paper, we draft a pattern language comprised of thirty patterns that we have observed from supervising over a hundred masters students within the last decade."
