abstract: Food production is responsible for a quarter of anthropogenic greenhouse
  gas (GHG) emissions globally. Marine fisheries are typically excluded from global
  assessments of GHGs or are generalized based on a limited number of case studies.
  Here we quantify fuel inputs and GHG emissions for the global fishing fleet from
  1990â€“2011 and compare emissions from fisheries to those from agriculture and livestock
  production. We estimate that fisheries consumed 40 billion litres of fuel in 2011
  and generated a total of 179 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent GHGs (4% of global
  food production). Emissions from the global fishing industry grew by 28% between
  1990 and 2011, with little coinciding increase in production (average emissions
  per tonne landed grew by 21%). Growth in emissions was driven primarily by increased
  harvests from fuel-intensive crustacean fisheries. The environmental benefit of
  low-carbon fisheries could be further realized if a greater proportion of landings
  were directed to human consumption rather than industrial uses.
