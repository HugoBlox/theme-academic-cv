abstract: The evidence for an equal distribution of biomass from bacteria to whales
  has led to development of size-spectrum models that represent the dynamics of the
  marine ecosystem using size rather than species identity. Recent advances have improved
  the realism of the fish component of the size-spectrum, but these often assume that
  small fish feed on an aggregated plankton size-spectrum, without any explicit representation
  of zooplankton dynamics. In these models, small zooplankton are grouped with phytoplankton
  as a resource for larval fish, and large zooplankton are parameterized as small
  fish. Here we investigate the impact of resolving zooplankton and their feeding
  traits in a dynamic size-spectrum model. First, we compare a base model, where zooplankton
  are parameterized as smaller fish, to a model that includes zooplankton-specific
  feeding parameters. Second, we evaluate how the parameterization of zooplankton
  feeding characteristics, specifically the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR), assimilation
  efficiency and feeding kernel width, affects the productivity and stability of the
  fish community. Finally, we compare how feeding characteristics of different zooplankton
  functional groups mediate increases in primary production and fishing pressure.
  Incorporating zooplankton-specific feeding parameters increased productivity of
  the fish community, but also changed the dynamics of the entire system from a stable
  to an oscillating steady-state. The inclusion of zooplankton feeding characteristics
  mediated a trade-off between the productivity and resilience of the fish community,
  and its stability. Fish communities with increased productivity and lower stability
  were supported by zooplankton with a larger PPMR and a narrower feeding kernel –
  specialized herbivores. In contrast, fish communities that were stable had lower
  productivity, and were supported by zooplankton with a lower PPMR and a wider feeding
  kernel – generalist carnivores. Herbivorous zooplankton communities were more efficient
  at mediating increases in primary production, and supported fish communities more
  resilient to fishing. Our results illustrate that zooplankton are not just a static
  food source for larger organisms, nor can they be resolved as very small fish. The
  unique feeding characteristics of zooplankton have enormous implications for the
  dynamics of marine ecosystems, and their representation is of critical importance
  in size-spectrum models, and end-to-end ecosystem models more broadly.
