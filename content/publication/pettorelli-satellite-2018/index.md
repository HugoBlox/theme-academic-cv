abstract: Societal, economic and scientific interests in knowing where biodiversity
  is, how it is faring and what can be done to efficiently mitigate further biodiversity
  loss and the associated loss of ecosystem services are at an all-time high. So far,
  however, biodiversity monitoring has primarily focused on structural and compositional
  features of ecosystems despite growing evidence that ecosystem functions are key
  to elucidating the mechanisms through which biological diversity generates services
  to humanity. This monitoring gap can be traced to the current lack of consensus
  on what exactly ecosystem functions are and how to track them at scales beyond the
  site level. This contribution aims to advance the development of a global biodiversity
  monitoring strategy by proposing the adoption of a set of definitions and a typology
  for ecosystem functions, and reviewing current opportunities and potential limitations
  for satellite remote sensing technology to support the monitoring of ecosystem functions
  worldwide. By clearly defining ecosystem processes, functions and services and their
  interrelationships, we provide a framework to improve communication between ecologists,
  land and marine managers, remote sensing specialists and policy makers, thereby
  addressing a major barrier in the field.
