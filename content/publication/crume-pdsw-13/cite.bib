 abstract = {Predicting access times is a crucial part of predicting hard disk drive performance. Existing approaches use white-box modeling and require intimate knowledge of the internal layout of the drive, which can take months to extract. Automatically learning this behavior is a much more desirable approach, requiring less expert knowledge, fewer assumptions, and less time. Others have created behavioral models of hard disk drive performance, but none have shown low per-request errors. A barrier to machine learning of access times has been the existence of periodic behavior with high, unknown frequencies. We show how hard disk drive access times can be predicted to within 0.83 ms using a neural net after these frequencies are found using Fourier analysis.},
