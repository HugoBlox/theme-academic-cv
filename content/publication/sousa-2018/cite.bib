 abstract = {Cloud software continues to expand globally, highly motivated by the how widespread the Internet is and the possibilities it unlocks with Cloud Computing. Still, cloud development has some intrinsic properties to it, making it complex to unexperienced developers. This research is capturing those intricacies in the form of a pattern language which gathers over 12 patterns for engineering software for the cloud. This paper elaborates on that research by contributing with two new patterns: Automated Recovery which checks if a container is working properly, automatically recovering it in case of failure and Scheduler, which periodically executes actions within the infrastructure. The described patterns are useful for anyone designing software for the cloud, either to bootstrap or validate their design decisions and ultimately enable them to create better software},
