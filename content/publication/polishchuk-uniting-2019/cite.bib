 abstract = {Science is a search for patterns but there are few cross-habitat patterns in ecology. We propose key questions following the findings of consistent scaling of abundance versus body mass from bacteria to earthworms and whales, based on an almost forgotten study of soils and a well-known one from the open ocean.},
