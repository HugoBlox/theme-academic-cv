abstract: Science is a search for patterns but there are few cross-habitat patterns
  in ecology. We propose key questions following the findings of consistent scaling
  of abundance versus body mass from bacteria to earthworms and whales, based on an
  almost forgotten study of soils and a well-known one from the open ocean.
