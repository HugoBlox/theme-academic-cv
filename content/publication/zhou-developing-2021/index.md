abstract: South and Southeast Asia is subject to significant hydrometeorological extremes,
  including drought. Under rising temperatures, growing populations, and an apparent
  weakening of the South Asian monsoon in recent decades, concerns regarding drought
  and its potential impacts on water and food security are on the rise. Reliable sub-seasonal
  to seasonal (S2S) hydrological forecasts could, in principle, help governments and
  international organizations to better assess risk and act in the face of an oncoming
  drought. Here, we leverage recent improvements in S2S meteorological forecasts and
  the growing power of Earth observations to provide more accurate monitoring of hydrological
  states for forecast initialization. Information from both sources is merged in a
  South and Southeast Asia sub-seasonal to seasonal hydrological forecasting system
  (SAHFS-S2S), developed collaboratively with the NASA SERVIR program and end users
  across the region. This system applies the Noah-Multiparameterization (NoahMP) Land
  Surface Model (LSM) in the NASA Land Information System (LIS), driven by downscaled
  meteorological fields from the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) and Climate
  Hazards InfraRed Precipitation products (CHIRP and CHIRPS) to optimize initial conditions.
  The NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model sub-seasonal to seasonal (GEOS-S2S)
  forecasts, downscaled using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
  General Analog Regression Downscaling (GARD) tool and quantile mapping, are then
  applied to drive 5 km resolution hydrological forecasts to a 9-month forecast time
  horizon. Results show that the skillful predictions of root zone soil moisture can
  be made 1 to 2 months in advance for forecasts initialized in rainy seasons and
  up to 8 months when initialized in dry seasons. The memory of accurate initial conditions
  can positively contribute to forecast skills throughout the entire 9-month prediction
  period in areas with limited precipitation. This SAHFS-S2S has been operationalized
  at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) to support
  drought monitoring and warning needs in the region.
