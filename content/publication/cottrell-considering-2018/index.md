abstract: 'With the human population expected to near 10 billion by 2050, and diets
  shifting towards greater per-capita consumption of animal protein, meeting future
  food demands will place ever-growing burdens on natural resources and those dependent
  on them. Solutions proposed to increase the sustainability of agriculture, aquaculture,
  and capture fisheries have typically approached development from single sector perspectives.
  Recent work highlights the importance of recognising links among food sectors, and
  the challenge cross-sector dependencies create for sustainable food production.
  Yet without understanding the full suite of interactions between food systems on
  land and sea, development in one sector may result in unanticipated trade-offs in
  another. We review the interactions between terrestrial and aquatic food systems.
  We show that most of the studied land–sea interactions fall into at least one of
  four categories: ecosystem connectivity, feed interdependencies, livelihood interactions,
  and climate feedback. Critically, these interactions modify nutrient flows, and
  the partitioning of natural resource use between land and sea, amid a backdrop of
  climate variability and change that reaches across all sectors. Addressing counter-productive
  trade-offs resulting from land-sea links will require simultaneous improvements
  in food production and consumption efficiency, while creating more sustainable feed
  products for fish and livestock. Food security research and policy also needs to
  better integrate aquatic and terrestrial production to anticipate how cross-sector
  interactions could transmit change across ecosystem and governance boundaries into
  the future.'
