abstract: "Chautauqua is an exploratory workflow management system designed and implemented within the Collaboration Technology Research group (CTRG) at the University of Colorado. This system represents a tightly knit merger of workflow technology and groupware technology. Chautauqua has been in test usage at the University of Colorado since 1995. This document discusses Chautauqua - its motivation, its design, and its implementation. Our emphasis here is on its novel features, and the techniques for implementing these features."
