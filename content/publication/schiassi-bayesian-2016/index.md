abstract: In the Bayesian approach to solving inverse problems to parameter estimation,
  the quantities we seek to retrieve are considered as random variables. The randomness
  includes the uncertainty regarding their true values. We intend to use this approach
  to perform inversion of coupled radiative and heat transfer models for asteroid
  regoliths and lakes. The Bayesian inversion of this kind of models allows estimating
  optical and thermodynamic properties of the systems considered, and also allows
  finding any correlation among these properties; that would be quite difficult to
  find with the classical approaches.
