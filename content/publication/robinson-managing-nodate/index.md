abstract: Wild-caught fish are a bioavailable source of nutritious food that, if managed
  strategically, could enhance diet quality for billions of people. However, optimising
  nutrient production from the sea has not been a priority, hindering development
  of nutrition-sensitive policies. With fisheries management increasingly effective
  at rebuilding stocks and regulating sustainable fishing, we can now begin to integrate
  nutritional outcomes within existing management frameworks. Here, we develop a conceptual
  foundation for managing fisheries for multispecies Maximum Nutrient Yield (mMNY).
  We empirically test our approach using size-based models of North Sea and Baltic
  Sea fisheries and show that mMNY is predicted by the relative contribution of nutritious
  species to total catch and their vulnerability to fishing, leading to trade-offs
  between catch and specific nutrients. Simulated nutrient yield curves suggest that
  vitamin D, which is deficient in Northern European diets, was underfished at fishing
  levels that returned maximum catch weights. Analysis of global catch data shows
  there is scope for nutrient yields from most of the world's marine fisheries to
  be enhanced through nutrient-sensitive fisheries management. With nutrient composition
  data now widely available, we expect our mMNY framework to motivate development
  of nutrient-based reference points in specific contexts, such as data-limited fisheries.
  Managing for mMNY alongside policies that promote access to fish could help close
  nutrient gaps for coastal populations, maximising the contribution of wild-caught
  fish to global food and nutrition security.
