abstract: This paper presents a new approach to simultaneously schedule energy and
  reserve in an electricity market. The proposed model explicitly incorporates an
  n-K security criterion by which power balance is guaranteed under any contingency
  state comprising the simultaneous loss of up to K generation units. Instead of considering
  all possible contingency states, which would render the problem intractable, a novel
  method based on robust optimization is proposed. Using the notion of umbrella contingencies,
  the robust counterpart of the original problem is formulated. The resulting model
  is a particular instance of bilevel programming which is solved by its transformation
  to an equivalent single-level mixed-integer programming problem. Unlike previously
  reported contingency-dependent approaches, the robust model does not depend on the
  size of the contingency set, thus providing a computationally efficient framework.
  Simulation results back up these conclusions.
