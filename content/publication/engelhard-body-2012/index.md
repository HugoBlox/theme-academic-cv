abstract: Lesser sandeels Ammodytes marinus are eaten by a range of predatory fishes
  including commercially fished species, but are also exploited at large scale by
  industrial fisheries. Is availability of sandeels, as key prey source, linked to
  the body condition of predatory fishes? In the North Sea, the largest sandeel biomass
  is concentrated in the Dogger Bank region. Here we studied predator–sandeel interactions
  at two sites differing widely in sandeel abundance and local sandeel fishing effort.
  Surveys took place in 2004, 2005, and 2006, years when local sandeel densities observed
  at these sites were low, intermediate, and high, respectively. Five predator species––whiting,
  lesser weever, grey gurnard, plaice, and haddock––showed better body condition indices
  in either the years or study area (or both) characterised by higher local sandeel
  densities, when compared to sandeel-poorer conditions. Moreover, whiting, weever,
  and gurnard condition was better for those individuals actually observed to have
  eaten sandeels (based on stomach contents) than for those that had not. As body
  condition relates to growth, reproduction, and survival, predators in sandeel-rich
  conditions may be inferred to have a higher fitness. These links between sandeel
  availability, sandeel consumption, and predator condition hint that, if large-scale
  localised depletions of sandeels were to occur, negative indirect effects on predatory
  fish might become apparent, underlining the importance of considering the sandeel
  fishery in an ecosystem context.
