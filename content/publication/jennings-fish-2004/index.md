abstract: 1 Fishing changes the structure of fish communities and the relative impacts
  of fishing are assessed usefully against a baseline. A comparable baseline in all
  regions is fish community structure in the absence of fishing. 2 The structure of
  unexploited communities cannot always be predicted from historical data because
  fisheries exploitation usually precedes scientific investigation and non-fisheries
  impacts, such as climate change, modify ecosystems over time. 3 We propose a method,
  based on macroecological theory, to predict the abundance and size-structure of
  an unexploited fish community from a theoretical abundance–body mass relationship
  (size spectrum). 4 We apply the method in the intensively fished North Sea and compare
  the predicted structure of the unexploited fish community with contemporary community
  data. 5 We suggest that the current biomass of large fishes weighing 4–16 kg and
  16–66 kg, respectively, is 97·4% and 99·2% lower than in the absence of fisheries
  exploitation. The results suggest that depletion of large fishes due to fisheries
  exploitation exceeds that described in many short-term studies. 6 Biomass of the
  contemporary North Sea fish community (defined as all fishes with body mass 64 g−66
  kg) is 38% lower than predicted in the absence of exploitation, while the mean turnover
  time is almost twice as fast (falls from 3·5 to 1·9 years) and 70% less primary
  production is required to sustain it. 7 The increased turnover time of the fish
  community will lead to greater interannual instability in biomass and production,
  complicating management action and increasing the sensitivity of populations to
  environmental change. 8 This size-based method based on macroecological theory may
  provide a powerful new tool for setting ecosystem indicator reference levels, comparing
  fishing impacts in different ecosystems and for assessing the relative impacts of
  fishing and climate change.
