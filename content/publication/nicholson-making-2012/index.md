abstract: In order to influence global policy effectively, conservation scientists
  need to be able to provide robust predictions of the impact of alternative policies
  on biodiversity and measure progress towards goals using reliable indicators. We
  present a framework for using biodiversity indicators predictively to inform policy
  choices at a global level. The approach is illustrated with two case studies in
  which we project forwards the impacts of feasible policies on trends in biodiversity
  and in relevant indicators. The policies are based on targets agreed at the Convention
  on Biological Diversity (CBD) meeting in Nagoya in October 2010. The first case
  study compares protected area policies for African mammals, assessed using the Red
  List Index; the second example uses the Living Planet Index to assess the impact
  of a complete halt, versus a reduction, in bottom trawling. In the protected areas
  example, we find that the indicator can aid in decision-making because it is able
  to differentiate between the impacts of the different policies. In the bottom trawling
  example, the indicator exhibits some counter-intuitive behaviour, due to over-representation
  of some taxonomic and functional groups in the indicator, and contrasting impacts
  of the policies on different groups caused by trophic interactions. Our results
  support the need for further research on how to use predictive models and indicators
  to credibly track trends and inform policy. To be useful and relevant, scientists
  must make testable predictions about the impact of global policy on biodiversity
  to ensure that targets such as those set at Nagoya catalyse effective and measurable
  change.
