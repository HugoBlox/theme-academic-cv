abstract: Interest in sustainability has increased the share of variable renewable
  energy sources (VRES) in power generation. Energy storage systems' potential to
  mitigate intermittencies from non-dispatchable VRES has enhanced their appeal. However,
  the impacts of storage vary based on the owner and market conditions. We examine
  the policy implications of investments in utility-scale battery storage via a bi-level
  optimization model. The lower level depicts power system operations, modeled as
  either perfect competition or Cournot oligopoly to allow for the assessment of producer
  market power. The upper-level investor is either a welfare-maximizer or a profit-maximizing
  standalone merchant to reflect either welfare enhancement or arbitrage, respectively.
  We implement a realistic case study for Western Europe based on all possible size-location
  storage investment combinations. We find that market competition affects investment
  sizes, locations, and their profitability more than the investor's objectives. A
  welfare-maximizer under perfect competition invests the most in storage capacity.
  Consumers typically gain most from storage investments in all cases, exceeding the
  gains for the investors. Specifically, our results show that storage investments
  may either not occur or be located differently than at social optimum, if market
  power is exerted. Thus, policy makers need to anticipate producer market power when
  setting regulation.
