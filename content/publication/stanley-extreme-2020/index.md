abstract: Extreme precipitation from the South-Asian monsoon season combines with
  significant topographic relief within the Himalayan region to cause landslides that
  result in hundreds to thousands of fatalities each year. While there are few consistent
  and publicly available in-situ estimates of rainfall across this region, satellite
  products and global climate models provide insight into the extreme precipitation
  patterns that may impact the frequency of landsliding. In this work, we analyzed
  several extreme precipitation indices using data from a global climate model and
  the satellite-based Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation
  Analysis product to represent extreme precipitation over High Mountain Asia. We
  then compared the temporal distribution of extreme precipitation to a global database
  of landslides to better understand the spatiotemporal distribution of potential
  landslide triggering factors. We found that these indices successfully model the
  seasonality of landslide activity across the region, but other aspects of spatiotemporal
  variability require additional information and analysis before they can be applied
  more broadly.
