 abstract = {Proliferation of the Internet is enabling the use of sensors and actuators to capture data and control devices remotely in a multitude of domains. Still, there is a general lack of best practices while designing such large scale real-time systems. This paper describes a generic architecture used on the implementation of a framework for deploying such systems in the cloud, enabling run-time evolution of the system with new sensors, actuators or services possibly developed by third-parties being integrated dynamically. Such architecture orchestrates the flow of information in the ecosystem and scales transparently to external components when needed, requiring no change in them. Adoption in the Portuguese nation-wide AAL project AAL4ALL is then described. Copyright Â© 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc. (ACM).},
