abstract: We present a scenario decomposition framework based on Lagrangean decomposition
  for the multi-product, multi-period, supply investment planning problem considering
  network design and discrete capacity expansion under demand uncertainty. We also
  consider a risk measure that allows to reduce the probability of incurring in high
  costs while preserving the decomposable structure of the problem. To solve the resulting
  large-scale two-stage mixed-integer stochastic linear programming problem we propose
  a novel Lagrangean decomposition scheme, and compare different formulations for
  the non-anticipativity conditions. In addition, we present a new hybrid algorithm
  for updating the Lagrangean multiplier set based on the combination of cutting-plane,
  subgradient and trust-region strategies. Numerical results suggest that different
  formulations of the non-anticipativity conditions have a significant impact on the
  performance of the algorithm. Moreover, we observe that the proposed hybrid approach
  has superior performance in terms of faster computational times when compared with
  the traditional subgradient algorithm. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
