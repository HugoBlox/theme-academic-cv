abstract: 'The status of an exploited population is ideally determined by monitoring
  changes in abundance and distributional range and pattern over time. Area of occupancy
  is a measure of the current distribution. Unfortunately, for many populations, scientific
  abundance and distribution information is not readily available. To evaluate the
  reliability of commercial fishing data for deriving occupancy indicators that could
  serve as proxies for stock abundance, we investigated four questions: 1) Occupancy
  changes with stock biomass, but is this change strong enough to make occupancy a
  sensitive indicator of population biomass? 2) Fishing boats follow fish, but when
  does such activity alter the positive macroecological relationship between occupancy
  and abundance? 3) When does the activity of pursuing fish adversely affect occupancy
  estimates derived from catch and effort data? 4) How does uncertainty in fishing
  effort data affect occupancy estimates? Spatial simulations mimicking the dynamics
  of four deep-water fish species showed that biomass-occupancy relationships can
  be weak. Fishers following fish can modify the spatial distribution of target species,
  even reversing the sign of the biomass-occupancy relationship in certain cases,
  and can affect the reliability of occupancy indicators, which can also be impaired
  by error in effort data. Using commercial catch and effort data and abundance indices
  for deep-sea fish populations to the west of the British Isles it was found that
  only for roundnose grenadier might occupancy provide insights into biomass changes.
  In conclusion, care should be taken when using occupancy for evaluating range changes
  in cases where fishing might have modified spatial distributions, uncertain commercial
  data are used or when the abundance-occupancy relationship is too flat.'
