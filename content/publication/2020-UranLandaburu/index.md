abstract: "The volume of biological, chemical and functional data deposited
in the public domain is growing rapidly, thanks to next generation
sequencing and highly-automated screening technologies. These datasets
represent invaluable resources for drug discovery, particularly for less
studied neglected disease pathogens. To leverage these datasets, smart and
intensive data integration is required to guide computational inferences
across diverse organisms. We developed the TDR Targets chemogenomics
resource to integrate genomic data from human pathogens and model organisms
along with information on bioactive compounds and their annotated
activities. In this report we highlight the latest updates on the available
data and functionality in TDR Targets 6. Based on chemogenomic network
models providing links between inhibitors and targets, the database now
incorporates network-driven target prioritizations, and novel visualizations
of network subgraphs displaying chemical- and target-similarity
neighborhoods along with associated target-compound bioactivity links.
Available data can be browsed and queried through a new user interface, that
allow users to perform prioritizations of protein targets and chemical
inhibitors. As such, the database now facilitates the investigation of drug
repurposing against pathogen targets, which can potentially help in
identifying candidate targets for bioactive compounds with previously
unknown targets. TDR Targets is available at https://tdrtargets.org."
