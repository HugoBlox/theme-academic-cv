abstract: 1. Variation within species is an often-overlooked aspect of community ecology,
  despite the fact that the ontogenetic structure of populations influences processes
  right up to the ecosystem level. Accounting for traits at the individual level is
  an important advance in the implementation of trait-based approaches in understanding
  community structure and function.  2. We incorporate individual- and species-level
  traits into one succinct assemblage structure metric, fractional size, which is
  calculated as the length of an individual divided by its potential maximum length.
  We test the implementation of fractional size in demersal fish assemblages along
  a depth gradient in the deep sea. We use data from an extensive trawl survey at
  depths of 300â€“2030 m on the continental slope of the Rockall Trough, Northeast Atlantic,
  to compare changes in fractional size structure along an environmental gradient
  to those seen using traditional taxonomic and trait-based approaches.  3. The relationship
  between fractional size and depth was particularly strong, with the overall pattern
  being an increase with depth, implying that individuals move deeper as they grow.
  Body size increased with depth at the intraspecific and assemblage levels. Fractional
  size, size structure and species composition all varied among assemblages, and this
  variation could be explained by the depth that the assemblage occupied.  4. The
  inclusion of individual-level traits and population fractional size structure adds
  to our understanding at the assemblage level. Fractional size, or where an individual
  is in its growth trajectory, appears to be an especially important driver of assemblage
  change with depth. This has implications for understanding fisheries impacts in
  the deep sea and how these impacts may propagate across depths.
