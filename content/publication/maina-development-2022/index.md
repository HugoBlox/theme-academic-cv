abstract: Abstract Precipitation estimates are highly uncertain in complex regions
  such as High-Mountain Asia (HMA), where ground measurements are very difficult to
  obtain, and atmospheric dynamics poorly understood. Though gridded products derived
  from satellite-based observations and/or reanalysis can provide temporally and spatially
  distributed estimates of precipitation, there are significant inconsistencies in
  these products. As such, to date, there is little agreement in the community on
  the best and most accurate gridded precipitation product in HMA, which is likely
  area dependent because of HMAâ€™s strong heterogeneities and complex orography. Targeting
  these gaps, this article presents the development of a consensus ensemble precipitation
  product using three gridded precipitation datasets (the Integrated Multi-satellitE
  Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement IMERG, the Climate Hazards group
  Infrared Precipitation with Stations CHIRPS, and the ECMWF Reanalysis ERA5) with
  a localized probability matched mean (LPM) approach. We evaluate the performance
  of the LPM estimate along with a simple ensemble mean (EM) estimate to overcome
  the differences and disparities of the three selected constituent products on long-term
  averages and trends in HMA. Our analysis demonstrates that LPM reduces the high
  biases embedded in the ensemble members and provides more realistic spatial patterns
  compared to EM. LPM is also a good alternative for merging data products with different
  spatio-temporal resolutions. By filtering disparities among the individual ensemble
  members, LPM overcomes the problem of a certain product performing well only in
  a particular area and provides a consensus estimate with plausible temporal trends.
