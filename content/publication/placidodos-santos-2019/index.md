abstract: This paper presents the development of an enhanced L-Shaped method applied
  to an inventory management problem that considers a replenishment control system
  based on the periodic review (R, S) policy. We consider single-item one-echelon
  problems with uncertain demands and partial backorder that are modeled using two-stage
  stochastic programming. To enable the consideration of large-scale problems, the
  classical single-cut L-Shaped method and its extended multi-cut form were initially
  applied. Preliminary computational results indicated that the classical L-Shaped
  method outperformed its multi-cut counterpart, even though the former required more
  iterations to converge to the optimal solution. This observation inspired the development
  of the techniques presented for enhancing the L-Shape method, which consist of the
  combination of a novel acceleration technique with an efficient formulation and
  valid inequalities for the proposed model. Numerical experiments suggest that the
  proposed approach significantly reduced the computational time required to solve
  large-scale problems.
