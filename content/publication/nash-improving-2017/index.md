abstract: Functional diversity is thought to enhance ecosystem resilience, driving
  research focused on trends in the functional composition of fisheries, most recently
  with new reconstructions of global catch data. However, there is currently little
  understanding of how accounting for unreported catches (e.g. small-scale and illegal
  fisheries, bycatch and discards) influences functional diversity trends in global
  fisheries. We explored how diversity estimates varied among reported and unreported
  components of catch in 2010, and found these components had distinct functional
  fingerprints. Incorporating unreported catches had little impact on global-scale
  functional diversity patterns. However, at smaller, management-relevant scales,
  the effects of incorporating unreported catches were large (changes in functional
  diversity of up to 46%). Our results suggest there is greater uncertainty about
  the risks to ecosystem integrity and resilience from current fishing patterns than
  previously recognized. We provide recommendations and suggest a research agenda
  to improve future assessments of functional diversity of global fisheries.
