abstract: Human and climate induced land surface changes resulting from irrigation,
  snow cover decreases, and greening impact the surface albedo over High Mountain
  Asia (HMA). Here we use a partial information decomposition approach and remote
  sensing data to quantify the effects of the changes in leaf area index, soil moisture,
  and snow cover on the surface albedo in HMA, home to over a billion people, from
  2003 to 2020. The study establishes strong evidence of anthropogenic agricultural
  water use over irrigated lands (e.g., Ganges–Brahmaputra) which causes the highest
  surface albedo decreases (≤ 1%/year). Greening and decreased snow cover from warming
  also drive changes in visible and near-infrared surface albedo in different areas
  of HMA. The significant role of irrigation and greening in influencing albedo suggests
  the potential of a positive feedback cycle where albedo decreases lead to increased
  evaporative demand and increased stress on water resources.
