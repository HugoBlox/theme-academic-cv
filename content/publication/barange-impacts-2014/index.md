abstract: The future sustainability of global fisheries is unknown. Models of physical,
  biological and human responses to climate change are applied to 67 national exclusive
  economic zones, which cover 60% of global fishery catches. This allows prediction
  of climate change impacts on countries with different dependencies on fisheries.
