 abstract = {Software businesses are quickly moving towards the cloud. While cloud computing is not a new research subject, engineering software for the cloud is still a challenge, demanding broad knowledge over a multitude of processes and tools that most software development teams lack. This paper identifies and briefly describes the practices required to efficiently engineer software for the cloud. The authors use the concept of patterns to capture and share those practices and describe their possible usage in an exemplar sequence. Patterns are aggregated into categories, namely: DEVELOPMENT, DEPLOYMENT, EXECUTION, DISCOVERY AND COMMUNICATION, MONITORING and SUPERVISION. An example sequence of application for these patterns is described. The paper is targeted at newcomers, practitioners and expert developers of software for the cloud, guiding them through architectural decisions, at solving specific issues or just validating their decisions.},
