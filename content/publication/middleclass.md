# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In this paper, we argue that liquidity constraints are a strong determinant of individual social policy preferences. People who are liquidity constrained, due to, e.g., limited savings or access to credit, demand increased social insurance because they are unable to smooth consumption when faced with temporary economic shocks. Because liquidity constraints are prevalent across the income distribution, we show that self-interested support for the welfare state also exists among the wealthy. Our main analyses rely on detailed administrative and survey data from Denmark, and the core results are supported by cross-country analyses of data from the European Social Survey. Additional results based on individual historical savings patterns suggest that both permanent traits governing savings decisions and unexpected economic shocks matter for the manifestation of liquidity constraints in political preferences."
