abstract: textlessptextgreatertextlessstrongtextgreaterAbstract.textless/strongtextgreater
  A set of supraglacial ponds filled rapidly between April and July 2017 on Changri
  Shar Glacier in the Everest region of Nepal, coalescing into a textlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater∼180textless/spantextgreater&thinsp;000&thinsp;mtextlessspan
  class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm2$textless/spantextgreater lake before
  sudden and complete drainage through Changri Shar and Khumbu glaciers (15–17 July).
  We use PlanetScope and Pléiades satellite orthoimagery to document the system's
  evolution over its very short filling period and to assess the glacial and proglacial
  effects of the outburst flood. We also use high-resolution stereo digital elevation
  models (DEMs) to complete a detailed analysis of the event's glacial and geomorphic
  effects. Finally, we use discharge records at a stream gauge 4&thinsp;km downstream
  to refine our interpretation of the chronology and magnitude of the outburst. We
  infer largely subsurface drainage through both of the glaciers located on its flow
  path, and efficient drainage through the lower portion of Khumbu Glacier. The drainage

  water had a clear geomorphic impact on glacial and proglacial topography, including
  deep incision and landsliding along the Changri Nup proglacial stream, the collapse
  of shallow englacial conduits near the Khumbu terminus and extensive, enhanced bank
  erosion at least as far as 11&thinsp;km downstream below Khumbu Glacier. These sudden
  changes destroyed major trails in three locations, demonstrating the potential hazard
  that short-lived, relatively small glacial lakes pose.textless/ptextgreater
