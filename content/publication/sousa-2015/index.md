abstract: "Software businesses are redirecting their expansion towards service-oriented businesses models, highly supported by cloud computing. While cloud computing is not a new research subject, there's a clear lack of documented best practices on how to orchestrate cloud environments, either public, private or hybrid. This paper is targeted at DevOps practitioners and explores solutions for cloud orchestration, describing them as three patterns: a) SOFTWARE CONTAINERIZATION, providing resource sharing with minimal virtualization overhead, b) LOCAL REVERSE PROXY, allowing applications to access any service in a cluster abstracting its placement and c) ORCHESTRATION BY RESOURCE OFFERING, ensuring applications get orchestrated in a machine with the required resources to run it. The authors believe that these three DevOps patterns will help researchers and newcomers to cloud orchestration to identify and adopt existing best practices earlier, hence, simplifying software life cycle management."
