abstract: Investigating the trends in the major climatic variables over the Upper
  Indus Basin (UIB) region is difficult for many reasons, including highly complex
  terrain with heterogeneous spatial precipitation patterns and a scarcity of gauge
  stations. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was applied to simulate
  the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation and temperature over the Indus Basin
  from 2000 through 2015 with boundary conditions derived from the Climate Forecast
  System Reanalysis (CFSR) data. The WRF model was configured with three nested domains
  (d01&ndash;d03) with horizontal resolutions increasing inward from 36 km to 12 km
  to 4 km horizontal resolution, respectively. These simulations were a continuous
  run with a spin-up year (i.e., 2000) to equilibrate the soil moisture, snow cover,
  and temperature at the beginning of the simulation. The simulations were then compared
  with TRMM and station data for the same time period using root mean squared error
  (RMSE), percentage bias (PBIAS), mean bias error (MBE), and the Pearson correlation
  coefficient. The results showed that the precipitation and temperature simulations
  were largely improved from d01 to d03. However, WRF tended to overestimate precipitation
  and underestimate temperature in all domains. This study presents high-resolution
  climatological datasets, which could be useful for the study of climate change and
  hydrological processes in this data-sparse region.
