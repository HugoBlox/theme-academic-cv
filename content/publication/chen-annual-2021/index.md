abstract: Atmospheric warming is intensifying glacier melting and glacial-lake development
  in High Mountain Asia (HMA), and this could increase glacial-lake outburst flood
  (GLOF) hazards and impact water resources and hydroelectric-power management. There
  is therefore a pressing need to obtain comprehensive knowledge of the distribution
  and area of glacial lakes and also to quantify the variability in their sizes and
  types at high resolution in HMA. In this work, we developed an HMA glacial-lake
  inventory (Hi-MAG) database to characterize the annual coverage of glacial lakes
  from 2008 to 2017 at 30 m resolution using Landsat satellite imagery. Our data show
  that glacial lakes exhibited a total area increase of 90.14 kmtextlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm2$textless/spantextgreater
  in the period 2008–2017, a textlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater+6.90textless/spantextgreater
  % change relative to 2008 (textlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater1305.59±213.99textless/spantextgreater
  kmtextlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm2$textless/spantextgreater).
  The annual increases in the number and area of lakes were 306 and 12 kmtextlessspan
  class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm2$textless/spantextgreater, respectively,
  and the greatest increase in the number of lakes occurred at 5400 m elevation, which
  increased by 249. Proglacial-lake-dominated areas, such as the Nyainqêntanglha and
  central Himalaya, where more than half of the glacial-lake area (summed over a 1textlessspan

  grid) consisted of proglacial lakes, showed obvious lake-area expansion. Conversely,
  some regions of eastern Tibetan mountains and Hengduan Shan, where unconnected glacial
  lakes occupied over half of the total lake area in each grid, exhibited stability
  or a slight reduction in lake area. Our results demonstrate that proglacial lakes
  are a main contributor to recent lake evolution in HMA, accounting for 62.87 % (56.67
  kmtextlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm2$textless/spantextgreater)
  of the total area increase. Proglacial lakes in the Himalaya ranges alone accounted
  for 36.27 % (32.70 kmtextlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm2$textless/spantextgreater)
  of the total area increase. Regional geographic variability in debris cover, together
  with trends in warming and precipitation over the past few decades, largely explains
  the current distribution of supraglacial- and proglacial-lake area across HMA. The
  Hi-MAG database is available at textlessa href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4275164\"textgreaterhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4275164textless/atextgreater
  (Chen et al., 2020), and it can be used for studies of the complex interactions
  between glaciers, climate and glacial lakes, studies of GLOFs, and water resources.
