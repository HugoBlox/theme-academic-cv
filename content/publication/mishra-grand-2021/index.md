abstract: Climate-influenced changes in hydrology affect water-food-energy security
  that may impact up to two billion people downstream of the High Mountain Asia (HMA)
  region. Changes in water supply affect energy, industry, transportation, and ecosystems
  (agriculture, fisheries) and as a result, also affect the region's social, environmental,
  and economic fabrics. Sustaining the highly interconnected food-energy-water nexus
  (FEWN) will be a fundamental and increasing challenge under a changing climate regime.
  High variability in topography and distribution of glaciated and snow-covered areas
  in the HMA region, and scarcity of high resolution (in-situ) data make it difficult
  to model and project climate change impacts on individual watersheds. We lack basic
  understanding of the spatial and temporal variations in climate, surface impurities
  in snow and ice such as black carbon and dust that alter surface albedo, and glacier
  mass balance and dynamics. These knowledge gaps create challenges in predicting
  where and when the impact of changes in river flow will be the most significant
  economically and ecologically. In response to these challenges, the United States
  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) established the High Mountain
  Asia Team (HiMAT) in 2016 to conduct research to address knowledge gaps. This paper
  summarizes some of the advances HiMAT made over the past 5 years, highlights the
  scientific challenges in improving our understanding of the hydrology of the HMA
  region, and introduces an integrated assessment framework to assess the impacts
  of climate changes on the FEWN for the HMA region. The framework, developed under
  a NASA HMA project, links climate models, hydrology, hydropower, fish biology, and
  economic analysis. The framework could be applied to develop scientific understanding
  of spatio-temporal variability in water availability and the resultant downstream
  impacts on the FEWN to support water resource management under a changing climate
  regime.
