abstract: This paper presents a new approach for the contingency-constrained single-bus
  unit commitment problem. The proposed model explicitly incorporates an n - K security
  criterion by which power balance is guaranteed under any contingency state comprising
  the simultaneous loss of up to K generation units. Instead of considering all possible
  contingency states, which would render the problem intractable, a novel method based
  on robust optimization is proposed. Using the notion of umbrella contingency, the
  robust counterpart of the original problem is formulated. The resulting model is
  a particular instance of bilevel programming which is solved by its transformation
  to an equivalent single-level mixed-integer programming problem. Unlike previously
  reported contingency-dependent approaches, the robust model does not depend on the
  size of the set of credible contingencies, thus providing a computationally efficient
  framework. Simulation results back up these conclusions.
