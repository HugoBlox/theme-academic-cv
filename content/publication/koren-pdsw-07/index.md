abstract: "As users interact with file systems of ever increasing size, it is becoming more difficult for them to familiarize themselves with the entire contents of the file system. In petabyte-scale systems, users must navigate a pool of billions of shared files in order to find the information they are looking for. One way to help alleviate this problem is to integrate navigation and search into a common framework. One such method is faceted search. This method originated within the information retrieval community, and has proved popular for navigating large repositories, such as those in e-commerce sites and digital libraries. This paper introduces faceted search and outlines several current research directions in adapting faceted search techniques to petabyte-scale file systems."
