abstract: The impact of snow darkening by deposition of light-absorbing aerosols (LAAs)
  on snow cover over the Himalayas&ndash;Tibetan Plateau (HTP) and the influence on
  the Asian summer monsoon were investigated using the NASA Goddard Earth Observing
  System Model Version 5 (GEOS-5). The authors found that during April&ndash;May&ndash;June,
  the deposition of LAAs on snow led to a reduction in surface albedo, initiating
  a sequence of feedback processes, starting with increased net surface solar radiation,
  rapid snowmelt in the HTP and warming of the surface and upper troposphere, followed
  by enhanced low-level southwesterlies and increased dust loading over the Himalayas&ndash;Indo-Gangetic
  Plain. The warming was amplified by increased dust aerosol heating, and subsequently
  amplified by latent heating from enhanced precipitation over the Himalayan foothills
  and northern India, via the elevated heat pump (EHP) effect during June&ndash;July&ndash;August.
  The reduced snow cover in the HTP anchored the enhanced heating over the Tibetan
  Plateau and its southern slopes, in conjunction with an enhancement of the Tibetan
  Anticyclone, and the development of an anomalous Rossby wave train over East Asia,
  leading to a weakening of the subtropical westerly jet, and northward displacement
  and intensification of the Mei-Yu rain belt. The authors&rsquo; results suggest
  that the atmosphere-land heating induced by LAAs, particularly desert dust, plays
  a fundamental role in physical processes underpinning the snow&ndash;monsoon relationship
  proposed by Blanford more than a century ago.
