abstract = "This paper compares two methods to solve the classic problem of vehicle routing (VRP), well known for its acronym in English (Vehicle Routing Problem), introduced by Dantzig and Ramser in 1959, which is to minimize the cost to distribute the goods from one warehouse to a set of clients, which uses an accurate method of linear programming and goal heuristic based on genetic algorithms. The object of comparison is the benchmark problem developed by Christofides (1976). In the comparison will be considered historically the best results to date"
