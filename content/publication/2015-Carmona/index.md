abstract: "Complete characterization of antibody specificities associated
to natural infections is expected to provide a rich source of serologic
biomarkers with potential applications in molecular diagnosis, follow-up of
chemotherapeutic treatments, and prioritization of targets for vaccine
development. Here, we developed a highly-multiplexed platform based on
next-generation high-density peptide microarrays to map these specificities
in Chagas Disease, an exemplar of a human infectious disease caused by the
protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. As a proof of principle in this publication we
show the designed of a high-density peptide microarray
containing >175,000 overlapping 15mer peptides derived from 457 T.
cruzi proteins. Screening of these slides with antibodies purified
from infected patients and healthy donors demonstrated both a high technical
reproducibility as well as epitope mapping consistency when compared with
earlier low-throughput technologies. The power of high-density peptide chips
for the discovery of pathogen-specific linear B-cell epitopes from clinical
samples, hence set the stage for high-throughput biomarker discovery
screenings and proteome-wide studies of immune responses against pathogens."
