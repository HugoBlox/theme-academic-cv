abstract: 160 microscopic full field photographs containing the fungal element, obtained from patients with onychomycosis, and 297 microscopic full field photographs containing dissolved keratin obtained from normal nails were collected. Smaller patches containing fungi (n = 1835) and keratin (n = 5238) were extracted from these full field images. In order to detect fungus and keratin, VGG16 and InceptionV3 models were developed by the use of these patches. The diagnostic performance of models was compared with 16 dermatologists by using 200 test patches.
