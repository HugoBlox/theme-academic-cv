  In north-western Tibet (34.0textlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm∘$textless/spantextgreater&thinsp;N,
  82.2textlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm∘$textless/spantextgreater&thinsp;E)
  near lake Aru Co, the entire ablation areas of two glaciers (Aru-1 and Aru-2) suddenly
  collapsed on 17 July and 21 September 2016. The masses transformed into ice avalanches
  with volumes of 68 and textlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater83×10$^textrm6$textless/spantextgreater&thinsp;mtextlessspan
  class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm3$textless/spantextgreater and ran out
  up to 7&thinsp;km in horizontal distance, killing nine people. The only similar
  event currently documented is the textlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater130×10$^textrm6$textless/spantextgreater&thinsp;mtextlessspan

  rock and ice avalanche of 2002 (Caucasus Mountains). Using climatic reanalysis,
  remote sensing, and three-dimensional thermo-mechanical modelling, we reconstructed
  the Aru glaciers' thermal regimes, thicknesses, velocities, basal shear stresses,
  and ice damage prior to the collapse in detail. Thereby, we highlight the potential
  of using emergence velocities to constrain basal friction in mountain glacier models.
  We show that the frictional change leading to the Aru collapses occurred in the
  temperate areas of the polythermal glaciers and is not related to a rapid thawing
  of cold-based ice. The two glaciers experienced a similar stress transfer from predominant
  basal drag towards predominant lateral shearing in the detachment areas and during
  the 5–6 years before the collapses. A high-friction patch is found under the Aru-2
  glacier tongue, but not under the Aru-1 glacier. This difference led to disparate
  behaviour of both glaciers, making the development of the instability more visible
  for the Aru-1 glacier through enhanced crevassing and terminus advance over a longer
  period. In comparison, these signs were observable only over a few days to weeks
  (crevasses) or were absent (advance) for the Aru-2 glacier. Field investigations
  reveal that those two glaciers were underlain by soft, highly erodible, and fine-grained
  sedimentary lithologies. We propose that the specific bedrock lithology played a
  key role in the two Tibet and the Caucasus Mountains giant glacier collapses documented
  to date by producing low bed roughness and large amounts of till, rich in clay and
  silt with a low friction angle. The twin 2016 Aru collapses would thus have been
  driven by a failing basal substrate linked to increasing pore water pressure in
  the subglacial drainage system in response to increases in surface melting and rain
  during the 5–6 years preceding the collapse dates.textless/ptextgreater
