abstract: The population of common guillemots Uria aalge on Skomer Island, Wales has
  been monitored since 1963, and in the last 30 yr has increased at an almost constant
  rate of 5% yr -1 . A previous attempt to model the population based on intrinsic
  demographic parameters estimated over just five years failed to explain the observed
  population increase, probably because the estimate of juvenile survival was too
  low. This raised the possibility that immigration fuelled the population increase.
  Here we use textgreater 30 yr of detailed field observations to re-estimate key
  population parameters (productivity, adult survival and juvenile survival) in order
  to model the population. We show that the observed rate of increase can be explained
  by these intrinsic parameters, and we therefore conclude that immigration is not
  necessary to generate the observed population growth.
