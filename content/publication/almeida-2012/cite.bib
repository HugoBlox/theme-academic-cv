 abstract = {The quantity and complexity that end-users are increasingly demanding from their applications and devices makes it impractical for a software developer to "foresee" every possible combination and explore every valid alternative. One solution is to empower end-users with tools that allows them to explore their necessities in a collaborative framework, where novices and experts can co-exist and share. We believe that such a tool could not only reduce the number of "small", specific-tailored applications, but also foster discovery and experimentation. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag.},
