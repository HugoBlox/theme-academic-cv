abstract: Aerosol optical thickness (τaer) is a fundamental parameter for analyzing
  aerosol loading and associated radiative effects. The τaer can constrain many inversion
  algorithms using passive/active sensor measurements to retrieve other aerosol properties
  and/or the abundance of trace gases. In the next wave of spectroradiometric observations
  from geostationary platforms, we envision that a strategically distributed network
  of robust, well-calibrated ground-based spectroradiometers will comprehensively
  complement spaceborne measurements in spectral and temporal domains. Spectral τaer
  can be accurately obtained from direct-Sun measurements based on the Langley calibration
  method, which allows for the analysis of distinct spectral features of the calibration
  results. In this study, we present a spectral τaer retrieval algorithm for an in-house
  developed, field deployable spectroradiometer instrument covering wavelengths from
  ultraviolet to near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR). The spectral total optical thickness
  obtained from the Langley calibration method is partitioned into molecular and particulate
  components by utilizing a least squares method. The resulting high temporal-resolution
  τaer and Ångström Exponent can be used effectively for cloud screening. The new
  algorithm was applied to month-long measurements acquired from the rooftop at National
  Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center's Building 33.
  The retrieved τaer demonstrated excellent agreement with those from well-calibrated
  Aerosol Robotic Network Sun photometers at all overlapping wavelengths (correlation
  coefficients higher than 0.98). In addition, empirical stray light corrections considerably
  improved τaer retrievals at short wavelengths in the UV. The continuous spectrum
  of τaer from UV-Vis-NIR spectroradiometers is expected to provide more informative
  constraints for retrieval of additional aerosol properties such as refractive indices,
  size, and bulk vertical distribution.
