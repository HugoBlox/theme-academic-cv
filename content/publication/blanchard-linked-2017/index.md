abstract: Fisheries and aquaculture make a crucial contribution to global food security,
  nutrition and livelihoods. However, the UN Sustainable Development Goals separate
  marine and terrestrial food production sectors and ecosystems. To sustainably meet
  increasing global demands for fish, the interlinkages among goals within and across
  fisheries, aquaculture and agriculture sectors must be recognized and addressed
  along with their changing nature. Here, we assess and highlight development challenges
  for fisheries-dependent countries based on analyses of interactions and trade-offs
  between goals focusing on food, biodiversity and climate change. We demonstrate
  that some countries are likely to face double jeopardies in both fisheries and agriculture
  sectors under climate change. The strategies to mitigate these risks will be context-dependent,
  and will need to directly address the trade-offs among Sustainable Development Goals,
  such as halting biodiversity loss and reducing poverty. Countries with low adaptive
  capacity but increasing demand for food require greater support and capacity building
  to transition towards reconciling trade-offs. Necessary actions are context-dependent
  and include effective governance, improved management and conservation, maximizing
  societal and environmental benefits from trade, increased equitability of distribution
  and innovation in food production, including continued development of low input
  and low impact aquaculture.
