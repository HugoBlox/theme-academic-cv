abstract: Changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) in High Mountain Asia (HMA) could
  have major societal impacts, as the regionâ€™s large reservoirs of glaciers, snow,
  and groundwater provide a freshwater source to more than one billion people. We
  seek to quantify and close the budget of secular changes in TWS over the span of
  the GRACE satellite mission (2003-2016). To assess the TWS trend budget we consider
  a new high-resolution mass trend product determined directly from GRACE L1B data,
  glacier mass balance derived from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), groundwater variability
  determined from confined and unconfined well observations, and terrestrial water
  budget estimates from a suite of land surface model simulations with the NASA Land
  Information System (LIS). This effort is successful at closing the aggregated TWS
  trend budget over the entire HMA region, the glaciated portion of HMA, and the Indus
  and Ganges basins, where the full-region trends are primarily due to the glacier
  mass balance and groundwater signals. Additionally, we investigate the closure of
  TWS trends at individual 1-arc-degree mascons (area $approx$12,000 km$textasciicircum2$);
  a significant improvement in spatial resolution over previous analyses of GRACE-derived
  trends. This mascon-level analysis reveals locations where the TWS trends are well-explained
  by the independent datasets, as well as regions where they are not; identifying
  specific geographic areas where additional data and model improvements are needed.
  The accurate characterization of total TWS trends and its components presented here
  is critical to understanding the complex dynamics of the region, and is a necessary
  step towards projecting future water mass changes in HMA.
