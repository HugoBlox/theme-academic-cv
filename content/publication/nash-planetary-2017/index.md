abstract: Concepts underpinning the planetary boundaries framework are being incorporated
  into multilateral discussions on sustainability, influencing international environmental
  policy development. Research underlying the boundaries has primarily focused on
  terrestrial systems, despite the fundamental role of marine biomes for Earth system
  function and societal wellbeing, seriously hindering the efficacy of the boundary
  approach. We explore boundaries from a marine perspective. For each boundary, we
  show how improved integration of marine systems influences our understanding of
  the risk of crossing these limits. Better integration of marine systems is essential
  if planetary boundaries are to inform Earth system governance.
