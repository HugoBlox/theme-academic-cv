abstract: 'Changing temperature can substantially shift ecological communities by
  altering the strength and stability of trophic interactions. Because many ecological
  rates are constrained by temperature, new approaches are required to understand
  how simultaneous changes in multiple rates alter the relative performance of species
  and their trophic interactions. We develop an energetic approach to identify the
  relationship between biomass fluxes and standing biomass across trophic levels.
  Our approach links ecological rates and trophic dynamics to measure temperature-dependent
  changes to the strength of trophic interactions and determine how these changes
  alter food web stability. It accomplishes this by using biomass as a common energetic
  currency and isolating three temperature-dependent processes that are common to
  all consumerâ€“resource interactions: biomass accumulation of the resource, resource
  consumption and consumer mortality. Using this framework, we clarify when and how
  temperature alters consumer to resource biomass ratios, equilibrium resilience,
  consumer variability, extinction risk and transient vs. equilibrium dynamics. Finally,
  we characterise key asymmetries in species responses to temperature that produce
  these distinct dynamic behaviours and identify when they are likely to emerge. Overall,
  our framework provides a mechanistic and more unified understanding of the temperature
  dependence of trophic dynamics in terms of ecological rates, biomass ratios and
  stability.'
