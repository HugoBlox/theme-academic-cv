abstract: Significant phenotypic differences exist between the vascular endothelium
  of different organs, including cell-cell junctions, paracellular fluid transport,
  shape, and mural cell coverage. These organ-specific morphological features ultimately
  manifest as different functional capacities, as demonstrated by the dramatic differences
  in capillary permeability between the leaky vessels of the liver compared to the
  almost impermeable vasculature found in the brain. While these morphological and
  functional differences have been long appreciated, the molecular basis of endothelial
  organ specialization remains unclear. To determine the epigenetic and transcriptional
  mechanisms driving this functional heterogeneity, we profiled accessible chromatin,
  as well as gene expression, in six different organs, across three distinct time
  points, during murine development and in adulthood. After identifying both common,
  and organ-specific DNA motif usage and transcriptional signatures, we then focused
  our studies on the endothelium of the central nervous system. Using single cell
  RNA-seq, we identified key gene regulatory networks governing brain blood vessel
  maturation, including TCF/LEF and FOX transcription factors. Critically, these unique
  regulatory regions and gene expression signatures are evolutionarily conserved in
  humans. Collectively, this work provides a valuable resource for identifying the
  transcriptional regulators controlling organ-specific endothelial specialization
  and provides novel insight into the gene regulatory networks governing the maturation
  and maintenance of the cerebrovasculature.Competing Interest StatementConflicts,
