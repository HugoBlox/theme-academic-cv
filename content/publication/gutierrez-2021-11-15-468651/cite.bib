 abstract = {Significant phenotypic differences exist between the vascular endothelium of different organs, including cell-cell junctions, paracellular fluid transport, shape, and mural cell coverage. These organ-specific morphological features ultimately manifest as different functional capacities, as demonstrated by the dramatic differences in capillary permeability between the leaky vessels of the liver compared to the almost impermeable vasculature found in the brain. While these morphological and functional differences have been long appreciated, the molecular basis of endothelial organ specialization remains unclear. To determine the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms driving this functional heterogeneity, we profiled accessible chromatin, as well as gene expression, in six different organs, across three distinct time points, during murine development and in adulthood. After identifying both common, and organ-specific DNA motif usage and transcriptional signatures, we then focused our studies on the endothelium of the central nervous system. Using single cell RNA-seq, we identified key gene regulatory networks governing brain blood vessel maturation, including TCF/LEF and FOX transcription factors. Critically, these unique regulatory regions and gene expression signatures are evolutionarily conserved in humans. Collectively, this work provides a valuable resource for identifying the transcriptional regulators controlling organ-specific endothelial specialization and provides novel insight into the gene regulatory networks governing the maturation and maintenance of the cerebrovasculature.Competing Interest StatementConflicts, J.F.M. is a founder of and owns shares in Yap Therapeutics.},
