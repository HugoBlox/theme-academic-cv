abstract: "As with every software, Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems have their own life-cycle, from conception to construction, deployment, and operation. However, the testing requirements from these systems are slightly different due to their inherent coupling with hardware and human factors. Hence, the procedure of delivering new soft- ware versions in a continuous integration/delivery fashion must be adopted. Based on existent solutions (and inspired in other closely- related domains), we describe two common strategies that develop- ers can use for testing IoT systems, (1) Testbed and (2) Simulation- based Testing, as well as one recurrent solution for its deployment (3) Middleman Update"
