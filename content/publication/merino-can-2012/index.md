abstract: Expansion in the world's human population and economic development will
  increase future demand for fish products. As global fisheries yield is constrained
  by ecosystems productivity and management effectiveness, per capita fish consumption
  can only be maintained or increased if aquaculture makes an increasing contribution
  to the volume and stability of global fish supplies. Here, we use predictions of
  changes in global and regional climate (according to IPCC emissions scenario A1B),
  marine ecosystem and fisheries production estimates from high resolution regional
  models, human population size estimates from United Nations prospects, fishmeal
  and oil price estimations, and projections of the technological development in aquaculture
  feed technology, to investigate the feasibility of sustaining current and increased
  per capita fish consumption rates in 2050. We conclude that meeting current and
  larger consumption rates is feasible, despite a growing population and the impacts
  of climate change on potential fisheries production, but only if fish resources
  are managed sustainably and the animal feeds industry reduces its reliance on wild
  fish. Ineffective fisheries management and rising fishmeal prices driven by greater
  demand could, however, compromise future aquaculture production and the availability
  of fish products.
