abstract: "The workshop 'Spatial models in animal ecology, management and conservation'\
  \ held at Silwood Park (UK), 9-11 March 2010, aimed to synthesize recent progress\
  \ in modelling the spatial dynamics of individuals, populations and species ranges\
  \ and to provide directions for research. It brought together marine and terrestrial\
  \ researchers working on spatial models at different levels of organization, using\
  \ empirical as well as theory-driven approaches. Different approaches, temporal\
  \ and spatial scales, and practical constraints predominate at different levels\
  \ of organization and in different environments. However, there are theoretical\
  \ concepts and specific methods that can fruitfully be transferred across levels\
  \ and systems, including: habitat suitability characterization, movement rules,\
  \ and ways of estimating uncertainty."
