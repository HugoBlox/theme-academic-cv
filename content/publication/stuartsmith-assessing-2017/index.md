abstract: Reporting progress against targets for international biodiversity agreements
  is hindered by a shortage of suitable biodiversity data. We describe a cost-effective
  system involving Reef Life Survey citizen scientists in the systematic collection
  of quantitative data covering multiple phyla that can underpin numerous marine biodiversity
  indicators at high spatial and temporal resolution. We then summarize the findings
  of a continental-and decadal-scale State of the Environment assessment for rocky
  and coral reefs based on indicators of ecosystem state relating to fishing, ocean
  warming, and invasive species and describing the distribution of threatened species.
  Fishing impacts are widespread, whereas substantial warming-related change affected
  some regions between 2005 and 2015. Invasive species are concentrated near harbors
  in southeastern Australia, and the threatened-species index is highest for the Great
  Australian Bight and Tasman Sea. Our approach can be applied globally to improve
  reporting against biodiversity targets and enhance public and policymakers' understanding
  of marine biodiversity trends.
