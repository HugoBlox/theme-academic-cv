abstract: Summary In this study, we suggest pretest and shrinkage methods based on
  the generalised ridge regression estimation that is suitable for both multicollinear
  and high‐dimensional problems. We review and develop theoretical results for some
  of the shrinkage estimators. The relative performance of the shrinkage estimators
  to some penalty methods is compared and assessed by both simulation and real‐data
  analysis. We show that the suggested methods can be accounted as good competitors
  to regularisation techniques, by means of a mean squared error of estimation and
  prediction error. A thorough comparison of pretest and shrinkage estimators based
  on the maximum likelihood method to the penalty methods. In this paper, we extend
  the comparison outlined in his work using the least squares method for the generalised
  ridge regression.
