abstract: An ensemble Kalman filter is used to assimilate Advanced Microwave Scanning
  Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) observations of passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperatures
  (spectral differences, ΔTb) into land surface model estimates of snow mass over
  northwestern high mountain Asia (HMA). Trained support vector machines serve as
  the observation operator and map the geophysical modeled variables into ΔTb space
  within the assimilation framework. Evaluation of the assimilation routine is carried
  out through comparison of assimilated snow mass estimates with an in situ dataset.
  The assimilation framework helps improve the land surface model estimates through
  PMW ΔTb assimilation, particularly in terms of decreasing the domain-wide bias.
  The assimilation framework proved more effective during the (dry) snow accumulation
  season and decreased the bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) in snow mass estimates
  at 76% and 58% of the comparative pixels, respectively. During the snow ablation
  season, the PMW brightness temperature signal contained less information related
  to snow mass due to the presence of other concurrent geophysical features that effectively
  serve as noise during the snow mass update. The utilization of PMW ΔTb for accurate
  snow mass estimation in complex terrain such as HMA is dependent on a multitude
  of factors for optimal results; however, it does add utility to the land surface
  model if the relevant pitfalls are taken into consideration prior to the state variable
  update.
