abstract: Coral reefs provide food and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people
  as well as harbour some of the highest regions of biodiversity in the ocean. However,
  overexploitation, land-use change and other local anthropogenic threats to coral
  reefs have left many degraded. Additionally, coral reefs are faced with the dual
  emerging threats of ocean warming and acidification due to rising CO2 emissions,
  with dire predictions that they will not survive the century. This review evaluates
  the impacts of climate change on coral reef organisms, communities and ecosystems,
  focusing on the interactions between climate change factors and local anthropogenic
  stressors. It then explores the shortcomings of existing management and the move
  towards ecosystem-based management and resilience thinking, before highlighting
  the need for climate change-ready marine protected areas (MPAs), reduction in local
  anthropogenic stressors, novel approaches such as human-assisted evolution and the
  importance of sustainable socialecological systems. It concludes that designation
  of climate change-ready MPAs, integrated with other management strategies involving
  stakeholders and participation at multiple scales such as marine spatial planning,
  will be required to maximise coral reef resilience under climate change. However,
  efforts to reduce carbon emissions are critical if the long-term efficacy of local
  management actions is to be maintained and coral reefs are to survive.
