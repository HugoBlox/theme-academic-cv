abstract: "Repositories provide the information system's support to layer software environments. Initially, repository technology has been dominated by object representation issues. Teams are not part of the ball game. In this paper, we propose the concept of sharing processes which supports distribution and sharing of objects and tasks by teams. Sharing processes are formally specified as classes of non-deterministic f'mite automata connected to each other by deduction rules. They are intended to coordinate object access and communication for task distribution in large development projects. In particular, we show how interactions between both sharings improve object management."
