abstract: As one of the brightest natural surfaces on Earth, the darkening of snow
  by light-absorbing particles (LAPs) — dust, black carbon or microbial growth — can
  trigger albedo feedbacks and accelerate snowmelt. Indeed, an increase in black carbon
  deposition following the industrial revolution has led to the recognition that LAP
  radiative forcing has contributed to a reduction in the global cryosphere, with
  corresponding climatic impacts. This Review synthesizes our current understanding
  of the distribution of radiative forcing by LAPs in snow, and discusses the challenges
  that need to be overcome to constrain global impacts, including the limited scope
  of local-scale observations, limitations of remote sensing technology and the representation
  of LAP-related processes in Earth system models.
