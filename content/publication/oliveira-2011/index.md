abstract: "This article addresses the problem of schedul- ing in oil refineries. The problem consists of amulti-product plant scheduling, with two serial machine stages—a mixer and a set of tanks—which have resource constraints and oper- ate on a continuous flow basis. Two models were developed: thefirst using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and the second using genetic algorithms (GA). Theirmain objec- tive was to meet the whole forecast demand, observing the operating constraints of the refinery and minimizing thenum- ber of operational changes. A real-life data-set related to the production of fuel oil and asphalt in a large refinery was used. TheMILP andGAmodels proved to be good solutions for both primary objectives, but the GA model resulted in a smaller number of operational changes. The reason for this is that GA incorporates a multi-criteria approach, which is capable of adaptively updating the weights of the objective throughout the evolutionary process."
