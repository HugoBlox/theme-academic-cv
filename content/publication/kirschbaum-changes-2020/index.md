abstract: High Mountain Asia is impacted by extreme monsoonal rainfall that triggers
  landslides in large proportions relative to global distributions, resulting in substantial
  human impacts and damage to infrastructure each year. Previous landslide research
  has qualitatively estimated how patterns in landslide activity may change based
  on climate change scenarios. We present the first quantitative view of potential
  modulation in future landslide activity over the High Mountain Asia region leveraging
  a new landslide hazard model and precipitation data from satellite and Global Climate
  Model sources. In doing so, we find that the rate of increase in landslide activity
  at the end of the century is expected to be greatest over areas covered by current
  glaciers and glacial lakes, potentially exacerbating the impacts of cascading hazards
  on populations downstream. This work demonstrates the potential of Global Climate
  Models and satellite-based precipitation estimates to characterize landslide hazards
  at time scales affected by climate change.
