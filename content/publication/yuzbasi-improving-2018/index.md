abstract: 'An important issue is that the respiratory mortality may be a result of
  air pollution which can be measured by the following variables: temperature, relative
  humidity, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrocarbons, ozone
  and particulates. The usual way is to fit a model using the ordinary least squares
  regression, which has some assumptions, also known as Gauss-Markov assumptions,
  on the error term showing white noise process of the regression model. However,
  in many applications, especially for this example, these assumptions are not satisfied.
  Therefore, in this study, a quantile regression approach is used to model the respiratory
  mortality using the mentioned explanatory variables. Moreover, improved estimation
  techniques such as preliminary testing and shrinkage strategies are also obtained
  when the errors are autoregressive. A Monte Carlo simulation experiment, including
  the quantile penalty estimators such as Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net, is designed
  to evaluate the performances of the proposed techniques. Finally, the theoretical
  risks of the listed estimators are given.'
