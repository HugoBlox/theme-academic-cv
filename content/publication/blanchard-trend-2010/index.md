abstract: Time-series of ecological and exploitation indicators collected from 19
  ecosystems were analysed to investigate whether there have been temporal trends
  in the status of ﬁsh communities. Using linear and non-linear statistical methods,
  trends are reported for six indicators (mean length of ﬁsh in the community, mean
  lifespan, proportion of predatory ﬁsh, total biomass of surveyed species, mean trophic
  level of landings, and inverse ﬁshing pressure), and the redundancy of these indicators
  across ecosystems is evaluated. The expected direction of change for an ecosystem
  that is increasingly impacted by ﬁshing is a decline in all indicators. A mixture
  of negative and positive directions of change is recorded, both within and among
  all ecosystems considered. No consistent patterns in the redundancy of the ecological
  indicators across ecosystems emerged from the analyses, conﬁrming that each indicator
  provided complementary information on ecosystem status. The different trends in
  indicators may reﬂect differing historical exploitation patterns, management, and
  environmental regimes in these systems. Commitment to monitoring programmes and
  development of system-speciﬁc baseline, target, and threshold reference levels are
  required. Improved understanding of the responsiveness and performance of ecological
  indicators to management actions are needed to address adequately whether ecosystems
  are recovering from, or being further impacted by, ﬁshing, and whether management
  targets are being met. The relative effects of multiple environmental and ecological
  processes as well as multiple human-induced stressors that characterize exploited
  ecosystems also need to be quantiﬁed.
