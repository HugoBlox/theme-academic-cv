abstract: We evaluated the utility of Ecosim for exploring interactions between cetacean
  predators, their prey, and fisheries. We formulated six Ecosim parameterizations,
  representing alternative hypotheses of feeding interactions (functional response)
  between cetaceans and their main fish prey, and examined differences in the predicted
  responses to simulated harvesting regimes for minke whales and their prey. Regardless
  of the type of function response formulated, intense fishing on the main fish prey
  of minke whales had a longer-lasting negative impact on minke whales than when minke
  whale biomass was removed directly by harvesting. Consumption rate, biomass, feeding
  time and mortality of minke whales were all sensitive to the type of functional
  response specified. Inclusion of “handling time” limited minke whales consumption
  at high prey densities and predicted higher consumption at low prey densities; features
  characteristic of a type II functional response. Predicted decline and recovery
  rates of minke whales were slower than when consumption rates were not limited.
  Addition of “foraging time” adjustments resulted in more conservative estimates
  of decline and recovery. However, when “other mortality” was linked to time spent
  foraging, exposure to higher mortality at low prey densities, and reduced mortality
  at high prey densities resulted in dramatic differences in predicted biomass trajectory.
  Sensitivity to the “other mortality” assumption is important for cetaceans whose
  predation mortality is only a small proportion of total mortality. Differences in
  the feeding and biomass dynamics were also observed when prey availability to predators
  was represented by changes in prey vulnerability, confirming earlier reports that
  Ecosim predictions are sensitive to this parameter.
