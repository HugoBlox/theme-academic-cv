abstract: In response to multiple stressors, coral reef health has declined in recent
  decades, with reefs exhibiting reduced living coral and structural complexity, and
  a concomitant rise in the dominance of algal resources. Reef degradation alters
  food availability and reduces the diversity and density of refuges for prey. These
  changes affect predator–prey interactions and can have cascading impacts on food
  webs and fisheries productivity. We use a size-based ecosystem model of coral reefs
  that incorporates the influence of structural complexity, benthic primary production
  and detrital recycling to explore how predator–prey interactions and fisheries productivity
  respond to a gradient of reef degradation. We show that fisheries productivity overall
  may be robust to initial stages of reef degradation because the benefits of increased
  resources outweigh the costs of moderate refuge decline. However, the assemblage
  composition and size structure of reef fish will differ on degraded reefs, with
  herbivores and invertivores contributing relatively more to productivity. More significant
  losses of refuges associated with the erosion of structural complexity correspond
  to fisheries productivity losses of at least 35% compared to healthy reefs. Synthesis
  and applications. Our model provides fisheries managers with quantitative predictions
  about how fisheries productivity may change in response to the ongoing degradation
  of coral reefs. We predict an initial increase in productivity at intermediate reef
  degradation, followed by a drastic decline when structural complexity is lost. We
  also capture subtle changes to potential catch composition and fish size, including
  increases in smaller herbivorous and invertivorous fish from degraded reefs, which
  will undoubtedly impact fisheries value. On the one hand, our results reassure for
  continued productivity in the short term, but on the other, we warn against complacency.
  Management must change to capture any potential benefits to fisheries, and long-term
  sustainability still depends on the maintenance of complex coral reef habitats.
