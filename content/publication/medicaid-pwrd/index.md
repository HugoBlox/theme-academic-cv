abstract: "Starting in 2014, states received the option to expand Medicaid through the Affordable
Care Act (ACA). Many states chose to expand Medicaid whereas others opted out. In this
protocol, we describe a study to examine the impact of Medicaid expansion on mortality in
the continental United States from 2015-2018. We adopt the matching structure of Mann
et al. (2021) to estimate causal effects in this study. This protocol outlines both a standard
method of analyzing this policy choice along with a method employing a novel weighting
scheme to examine the effect of Medicaid expansion on those who stand to benefit most
from policy implementation: the individuals newly eligible for Medicaid."
