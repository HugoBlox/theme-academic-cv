abstract: "This paper introduces PopperCI, a continous integration (CI) service hosted at UC Santa Cruz that allows researchers to automate the end-to-end execution and validation of experiments. PopperCI assumes that experiments follow Popper, a convention for implementing experiments and writing articles following a DevOps approach that has been proposed recently. PopperCI runs experiments on public, private or government-fundend cloud infrastructures in a fully automated way. We describe how PopperCI executes experiments and present a use case that illustrates the usefulness of the service."
