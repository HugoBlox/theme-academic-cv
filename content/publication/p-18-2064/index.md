abstract = "Multilingual  learning  for  Neural  NamedEntity    Recognition    (NNER)    involvesjointly   training   a   neural   network   formultiple languages.  Typically, the goal isimproving th    e NER performance of one ofthe languages (the primary language) us-ing the other assisting languages. We showthat the divergence in the tag distributionsof  the  common  named  entities  betweenthe  p    rimary  and  assisting  languages  canreduce  the  effectiveness  of  multilinguallearning.    To  alleviate  this  problem,  wepropose a metric based on symmetric KLdivergence  to  filter  out  the      highly  diver-gent  training  instances  in  the  assistinglanguage.   We  empirically  show  that  ourdata selection strategy improves NER per-formance  in  many  languages,  includingthose with very     limited training data."
