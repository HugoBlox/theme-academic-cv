 abstract = {Multilingual  learning  for  Neural  NamedEntity    Recognition    (NNER)    involvesjointly   training   a   neural   network   formultiple languages.  Typically, the goal isimproving the NER performance of one ofthe languages (the primary language) us-ing the other assisting languages. We showthat the divergence in the tag distributionsof  the  common  named  entities  betweenthe  primary  and  assisting  languages  canreduce  the  effectiveness  of  multilinguallearning.    To  alleviate  this  problem,  wepropose a metric based on symmetric KLdivergence  to  filter  out  the  highly  diver-gent  training  instances  in  the  assistinglanguage.   We  empirically  show  that  ourdata selection strategy improves NER per-formance  in  many  languages,  includingthose with very limited training data.},
