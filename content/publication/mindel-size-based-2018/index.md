abstract: 'Size-based indicators are well established as a management tool in shelf
  seas as they respond to changes in fishing pressure and describe important aspects
  of community function. In the deep sea, however, vital rates are much slower and
  body size relationships vary with depth, making it less clear how size-based indicators
  can be applied and whether they are appropriate for detecting changes through time.
  The deep-sea fish stocks of the North Atlantic underwent a period of exploitation
  followed by management and conservation action that relieved this pressure. We used
  data from a deep-water bottom trawl survey in the Rockall Trough, at depths of 300â€“2000
  m, to test whether size-based indicators changed over a 16-year period, during which
  fishing pressure decreased. We applied four indicators to these data: mean body
  length, mean maximum length, large fish indicator (LFI), and the slope of the biomass
  spectrum. Patterns were analysed within four different depth bands. The LFI and
  slope of the biomass spectrum showed positive change over time, suggesting recovery
  from fishing pressure. This response was generally most apparent in the shallowest
  depth band, where most fishing activity has been distributed. Values of the LFI
  were much higher overall than in shelf seas, so the same reference points cannot
  be applied to all marine ecosystems. These findings imply that size-based indicators
  can be usefully applied to the deep sea and that they potentially track changes
  in fishing pressure in the medium term.'
