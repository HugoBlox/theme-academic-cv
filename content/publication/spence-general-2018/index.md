abstract: When making predictions about ecosystems, we often have available a number
  of different ecosystem models that attempt to represent their dynamics in a detailed
  mechanistic way. Each of these can be used as a simulator of large-scale experiments
  and make projections about the fate of ecosystems under different scenarios to support
  the development of appropriate management strategies. However, structural differences,
  systematic discrepancies and uncertainties lead to different models giving different
  predictions. This is further complicated by the fact that the models may not be
  run with the same functional groups, spatial structure or time scale. Rather than
  simply trying to select a “best” model, or taking some weighted average, it is important
  to exploit the strengths of each of the models, while learning from the differences
  between them. To achieve this, we construct a flexible statistical model of the
  relationships between a collection of mechanistic models and their biases, allowing
  for structural and parameter uncertainty and for different ways of representing
  reality. Using this statistical meta-model, we can combine prior beliefs, model
  estimates and direct observations using Bayesian methods and make coherent predictions
  of future outcomes under different scenarios with robust measures of uncertainty.
  In this study, we take a diverse ensemble of existing North Sea ecosystem models
  and demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to answer the question
  what would have happened to demersal fish if fishing was to stop.
