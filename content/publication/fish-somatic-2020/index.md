abstract: 'Rationale:  We previously identified somatic activating mutations in the
  KRAS gene in the endothelium of the majority of human sporadic brain arteriovenous
  malformations (bAVMs); a disorder characterized by direct connections between arteries
  and veins. However, whether this genetic abnormality alone is sufficient for lesion
  formation, as well as how active KRAS signaling contributes to AVM formation, remains
  unknown.    Objective:  To establish the first in vivo models of somatic KRAS gain
  of function in the endothelium in both mice and zebrafish in order to directly observe
  the phenotypic consequences of constitutive KRAS activity at a cellular level in
  vivo, and to test potential therapeutic interventions for AVMs.    Methods and Results:  Using
  both postnatal and adult mice, as well as embryonic zebrafish, we demonstrate that
  endothelial-specific gain of function mutations in Kras (G12D or G12V) are sufficient
  to induce bAVMs. Active KRAS signaling leads to altered endothelial cell morphogenesis
  and increased cell size, ectopic sprouting, expanded vessel lumen diameter, and
  direct connections between arteries and veins. Furthermore, we show that these lesions
  are not associated with altered endothelial growth dynamics or a lack of proper
  arteriovenous identity, but instead appear to feature exuberant angiogenic signaling.
  Finally, we demonstrate that KRAS-dependent AVMs in zebrafish are refractory to
  inhibition of the downstream effector PI3K, but instead require active MEK signaling.    Conclusions:  We
  demonstrate that active KRAS expression in the endothelium is sufficient for bAVM
  formation, even in the setting of uninjured adult vasculature. Furthermore, the
  finding that KRAS-dependent lesions are reversible in zebrafish suggests that MEK
  inhibition may represent a promising therapeutic treatment for AVM patients.'
