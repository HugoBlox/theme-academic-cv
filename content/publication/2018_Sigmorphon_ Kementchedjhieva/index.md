abstract = "This paper documents the Team Copenhagen system which placed first in the CoNLL--SIGMORPHON 2018 shared task on universal morphological reinflection, Task 2 with an overall accuracy of 49.87. Task 2 focuses on morphological inflection in context: generating an inflected word form, given the lemma of the word and the context it occurs in. Previous SIGMORPHON shared tasks have focused on context-agnostic inflection---the 'inflection in context' task was introduced this year. We approach this with an encoder-decoder architecture over character sequences with three core innovations, all contributing to an improvement in performance: (1) a wide context window; (2) a multi-task learning approach with the auxiliary task of MSD prediction; (3) training models in a multilingual fashion."
