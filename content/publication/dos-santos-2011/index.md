abstract: Efficient management of the natural gas business chain - based on pipeline
  transmission networks and taking into consideration the interaction among the main
  players (e.g., shippers, suppliers, transmission companies and local distribution
  companies) - requires the use of decision-making support systems. These support
  systems maximise resources and mitigate contingencies due to gas supply shortfalls,
  operational contingencies from scheduled and non-scheduled equipment outages and
  market demand shortfalls. This study presents a practical use for technologies,
  such as a thermohydraulic simulation of gas flow through pipelines, a Monte Carlo
  simulation for compressor station availability studies, an economic risk evaluation
  related to potential revenue losses and contractual penalties and linear programming
  for the maximisation of income and the minimisation of contractual penalties. The
  proposed system allows the optimum availability level to be defined and maintained
  by the Transporter (by installing reserve capacity) to mitigate losses related to
  revenue and contractual penalties. It also economically identifies, quantifies and
  justifies the installation of stand-by compressor units that can mitigate the Transporter's
  exposure to losses caused by capacity shortfalls as a consequence of scheduled and
  non-scheduled outages. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
