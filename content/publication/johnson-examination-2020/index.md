abstract: 'Due to their high sensitivity to changes in climate, glaciers are one of
  the best natural indicators of climate change. Despite this, many underlying processes
  that control glacier response to climate change are poorly understood. One potentially
  important set of such processes are feedback mechanisms that can amplify or dampen
  glacier melt in response to a change in climate. Though feedbacks are recognized
  as important processes affecting glacier mass balances, little has been done to
  systematically quantify their effects. This study develops a surface energy and
  mass balance model to quantify the contribution of the albedo-feedback to glacier
  mass balance. Specifically, we quantify the roles of three trigger processes that
  initiate the albedo-feedback: snowpack thickness, snowfall event frequency, and
  heat flux supplied by precipitation. The model follows common energy balance methods
  but includes “switches” to turn these trigger processes off. The model is applied
  to Chhota Shigri Glacier using meteorological inputs from three different climate
  regions in High Mountain Asia (HMA). The results show that up to 80% of the average
  glacier melt increase from a +1°C temperature change can be attributed to the albedo-feedback.
  Furthermore, the system gain due to the albedo-feedback depends most on snowfall
  event frequency and the availability of incoming shortwave radiation during the
  melt season, and are thus generally largest in summer accumulation settings of HMA.
  This sensitivity to snowfall timing and frequency results in system gains being
  highest near the equilibrium line altitude, where a small change in temperature
  can shift precipitation phase from snow to rain. Regional analysis using climatological
  estimates suggests that many glaciers in the monsoonal Himalayas and southern Tibetan
  Plateau are likely to exhibit particularly strong albedo feedbacks. These results
  contribute to a growing body of literature suggesting that the mass balance of summer-accumulation
  type glaciers is strongly controlled by summer snowfall amount and frequency, which
  is closely linked with changes in air temperature. It also highlights the significance
  of the albedo feedback on glacier mass balance and the need to further explore feedbacks
  associated with glacier surface processes.'
