abstract: This section provides the preface of Volume 45 of the book Advances in Ecological
  Research. The seven papers in this volume are the product of collaborations resulting
  from the activities of Sizemic, and the evolution of the ideas that are presented
  in the chapters. Sizemic has been an important venue for this initial stage of cross-fertilization
  to occur, and its inception may be seen in hindsight as one of the decisive moments
  when fisheries science and other branches of ecology became engaged anew.
