abstract: Biodiversity is well studied in ecology and the concept has been developed
  to include traits of species, rather than solely taxonomy, to better reflect the
  functional diversity of a system. The deep sea provides a natural environmental
  gradient within which to study changes in different diversity metrics, but traits
  of deep-sea fish are not widely known, hampering the application of functional diversity
  to this globally important system. We used morphological traits to determine the
  functional richness and functional divergence of demersal fish assemblages along
  the continental slope in the Northeast Atlantic, at depths of 300â€“2,000 m. We compared
  these metrics to size diversity based on individual body size and species richness.
  Functional richness and size diversity showed similar patterns, with the highest
  diversity at intermediate depths; functional divergence showed the opposite pattern,
  with the highest values at the shallowest and deepest parts of the study site. Species
  richness increased with depth. The functional implications of these patterns were
  deduced by examining depth-related changes in morphological traits and the dominance
  of feeding guilds as illustrated by stable isotope analyses. The patterns in diversity
  and the variation in certain morphological traits can potentially be explained by
  changes in the relative dominance of pelagic and benthic feeding guilds. All measures
  of diversity examined here suggest that the deep areas of the continental slope
  may be equally or more diverse than assemblages just beyond the continental shelf.
