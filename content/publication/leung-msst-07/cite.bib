 abstract = {Achieving performance, reliability, and scalability presents a unique set of challenges for large distributed storage. To identify problem areas, there must be a way for developers to have a comprehensive view of the entire storage system. That is, users must be able to understand both node specific behavior and complex relationships between nodes. We present a distributed file system profiling method that supports such analysis. Our approach is based on combining node-specific metrics into a single cohesive system image. This affords users two views of the storage system: a micro, per-node view, as well as, a macro, multi- node view, allowing both node-specific and complex inter- nodal problems to be debugged. We visualize the storage system by displaying nodes and intuitively animating their metrics and behavior allowing easy analysis of complex problems.},
