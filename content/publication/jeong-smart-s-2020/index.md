abstract: The SMART-s (Spectral Measurements for Atmospheric Radiative Transfer—spectroradiometer)
  acquires Sun/sky observations for retrieving optimal information on trace gases
  and aerosols with minimal assumptions. Overall, the algorithm of SMART-s incorporates
  a series of retrievals, from fundamental quantities (i.e., column abundance of trace
  gases and aerosol loading) to higher-order geophysical parameters (e.g., aerosol
  physicochemical properties and vertical profiles), utilizing Sun/sky spectral radiance
  measurements. This paper describes the theoretical basis for column retrievals of
  trace gases and aerosols. Associated profile retrievals will be presented in follow-up
  papers. The current algorithm retrieves the fine/coarse mode of the particle size
  distribution and spectral complex index of refraction and, thereby, the spectral
  aerosol single-scattering albedo ω0. SMART-s retrieval is unique particularly in
  its high spectral resolution of the complex index of refraction and ω0 from near-ultraviolet
  to near-infrared wavelengths, which is pivotal information for atmospheric chemistry,
  climate and other inversions. We theoretically assessed information content and
  retrieval accuracy of the algorithm and compared different type of measurements
  including the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and standard Pandora. For the same
  levels of radiometric accuracy, SMART-s measurements provide the most informative
  aerosol retrievals based on theoretical error analyses. Higher spectral resolution
  measurements are particularly beneficial for particle size distribution and fine-mode
  refractive index retrievals. We applied this algorithm to the AERONET Sun/sky measurements
  at Kanpur, India, in 2016 to assess algorithm consistency. Even with different assumptions
  and numerical methods for the inversion, SMART-s retrieved aerosol parameters agreed
  well with the AERONET operational products (e.g., absolute mean bias errors less
  than 0.01 for ω0).
