abstract: On April 20, 2017, a flood from the Barun River, Makalu-Barun National Park,
  eastern Nepal formed a 2–3-km-long lake at its confluence with the Arun River as
  a result of blockage by debris. Although the lake drained spontaneously the next
  day, it caused nationwide concern and triggered emergency responses. We identified
  the primary flood trigger as a massive rockfall from the northwest face of Saldim
  Peak (6388 m) which fell approximately 570 m down to the unnamed glacier above Langmale
  glacial lake, causing a massive dust cloud and hurricane-force winds. The impact
  also precipitated an avalanche, carrying blocks of rock and ice up to 5 m in diameter
  that plummeted a further 630 m down into Langmale glacial lake, triggering a glacial
  lake outburst flood (GLOF). The flood carved steep canyons, scoured the river’s
  riparian zone free of vegetation, and deposited sediment, debris, and boulders throughout
  much of the river channel from the settlement of Langmale to the settlement of Yangle
  Kharka about 6.5 km downstream. Peak discharge was estimated at 4400 ± 1800 m3 s−1,
  and total flood volume was estimated at 1.3 × 106 m3 of water. This study highlights
  the importance of conducting integrated field studies of recent catastrophic events
  as soon as possible after they occur, in order to best understand the complexity
  of their triggering mechanisms, resultant impacts, and risk reduction management
  options.
