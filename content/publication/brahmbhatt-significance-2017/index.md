abstract: A study has been carried out in part of Chenab basin, Himalaya to understand
  the relationship between glacio-morphological factors and change in glacial area.
  Initially change in areal extent of glaciers was derived for two time frames (1962-2001/02
  and 2001/02-2010/11). The study comprised of 324 glaciers for the monitoring period
  of 1962-2001/02 for, which 11% loss in glacial area was observed. Two hundred and
  thirty-eight glaciers were further monitored between 2001/02 and 2010/11. These
  glaciers showed an area loss of 1.1%. The annual deglaciation has been found to
  be higher during the period of 1962-2001/02 compared to 2001/02-2010/11. The spatial
  and temporal variability in deglaciation was also addressed using glacio-morphic
  parameters. Area, length, percentage of debris cover, and various elevation parameters
  of glaciers were observed to have significant controls on relationships to the rate
  of glacial shrinkage. Larger-area and longer glaciers show a lower percentage of
  retreat than smaller and shorter ones. Moreover, glaciers located at lower altitudes
  and having gentle slopes show more area retreat. The results of area retreat in
  debris covered and debris free glaciers supports that the glaciers covered by debris
  retard ice melting at some extent. 158 glaciers were observed having no debris cover,
  and these exhibit 14% of loss in surface area. In glaciers having 40% debris cover,
  8% of deglaciation was observed. The glaciers located below equilibrium line altitude
  (ELA) have experienced 4.6% of deglaciation for the time frame 2001/02â€“2010/11 whereas
  it was found to be 1.1% for the glaciers occurring above ELA. However, the orientation
  of glaciers did not show any considerable influence on glacial change based on hypothesis.
