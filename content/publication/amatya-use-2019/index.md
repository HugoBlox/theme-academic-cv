abstract: The Karnali highway is a vital transport link and the only primary roadway
  that connects the remote Karnali region to the lowlands in Mid-Western Nepal. Every
  year there are reports of landslides blocking the road, making this area largely
  inaccessible. However, little effort has focused on systematically identifying landslides
  and landslide-prone areas along this highway. In this study, landslides were mapped
  with an object-based approach from very high-resolution optical satellite imagery
  obtained by the DigitalGlobe constellation in 2012 and PlanetScope in 2018. Landslides
  ranging from 10 to 30,496 m2 were detected within a 3 km buffer along the highway.
  Most of the landslides were located at lower elevations (between 500&ndash;1500
  m) and on steep south-facing slopes. Landslides tended to cluster closer to the
  highway, near drainage channels and away from faults. Landslides were also most
  prevalent within the Kuncha Formation geologic class, and the forested and agricultural
  land cover classes. A susceptibility map was then created using a logistic regression
  methodology to highlight patterns in landslide activity. The landslide susceptibility
  map showed a good prediction rate with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90. A
  total of 33% of the study arealies in high/very high susceptibility zones. The map
  highlighted the lower elevated areas between Bangesimal and Manma towns with the
  Kuncha Formation geologic class as being the most hazardous. The banks of the Karnali
  River, its tributaries and areas near the highway were also highly susceptible to
  landslides. The results highlight the potential of very high-resolution optical
  imagery for documenting detailed spatial information on landslide occurrence, which
  enables susceptibility assessment in remote and data scarce regions such as the
  Karnali highway.
