abstract: Computer-Assisted Language Learning can be facilitated to a great degree using commercial off-the-shelf video games. This paper attempts to explore the nature of CALL, the pedagogic qualities of video games and how the two intersect to produce useful CALL environments. Also considered are aspects of fun, what causes second language acquisition students to respond to one form of CALL over another, and concepts of ludus, paidea and narratology. An example, Heavy Rain, is offered as a potential commercial off-the-shelf game to use in second language acquisition at the university or adult-learning level.
