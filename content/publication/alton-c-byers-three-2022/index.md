abstract: Glacial lake outburst floods, and specifically those triggered by avalanche-induced
  seiche waves, have been studied in considerable detail during the past several decades.
  Less attention has been given to other cryospheric flood phenomena, which include
  floods sourced primarily from englacial conduits, permafrost-linked rockfall and
  avalanches, and earthquake-triggered glacial lake floods. The article reviews examples
  of each phenomenon, based on field sampling and laboratory analyses, that have occurred
  in the Nepal Himalaya during the past decade, drawing parallels with similar events
  in other countries throughout the high mountain world. In most cases, the frequency
  of these events appears to be increasing globally, as is their potential to inflict
  significant damage downstream. We argue that each type of glacier flood requires
  more detailed study to develop the most effective prevention, mitigation, and adaptation
  approaches possible. Such studies will most likely be strengthened if they include
  a reconnaissance of the event as soon after its occurrence as possible, along with
  the participation, insights, and experience of local people, in addition to the
  use of increasingly powerful remote sensing technologies. How scientists can more
  quickly and effectively share the results of their research with decision-makers,
  and how decision-makers and governments can deliver more timely mitigation programs,
  are areas that also require further strengthening.
