abstract: 'Ecological indicators are widely used to characterise ecosystem health.
  In the marine environment, indicators have been developed to assess the ecosystem
  effects of fishing to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries. However, very
  little work on the performance and robustness of ecological indicators has been
  carried out. An important aspect of robustness is that indicators should respond
  specifically to changes in the pressures they are designed to detect (e.g. fishing)
  rather than changes in other drivers (e.g. environment). We adopted a multi-model
  approach to compare and test the specificity of commonly used ecological indicators
  to capture fishing effects in the presence of environmental change and under different
  fishing strategies. We tested specificity in the presence of two types of environmental
  change: “random”, representing interannual climate variability and “directional”,
  representing climate change. We used phytoplankton biomass as a proxy of the environmental
  conditions, as this driver was comparable across all ecosystem models, then applied
  a signal-to-noise ratio analysis to test the specificity of indicators with random
  environmental change. For directional change, we used mean gradients to apportion
  the quantity of change in the indicators due to fishing and the environment. We
  found that depending on the fishing strategy and environmental change, ecological
  indicators could range from high to low specificity to fishing. As expected, the
  specificity of indicators to fishing almost always decreased as environmental variability
  increased. In 55–76% of the scenarios run with directional change in phytoplankton
  biomass across fishing strategies and ecosystem models, indicators were significantly
  more responsive to changes in fishing than to changes in phytoplankton biomass.
  This important result makes the tested ecological indicators good candidates to
  support fisheries management in a changing environment. Among the indicators, the
  catch over biomass ratio was most often the most specific indicator to fishing,
  whereas mean length was most often the most sensitive to change in phytoplankton
  biomass. However, the responses of indicators were highly variable depending on
  the ecosystem and fishing strategy under consideration. We therefore recommend that
  indicators should be tested in the particular ecosystem before they are used for
  monitoring and management purposes.'
