 abstract = {In this special section we bring you a practice and experience effort in reproducibility for large-scale computational science at SC20. This section includes nine critiques, each by a student team that reproduced results from a paper published at SC19, during the following year's Student Cluster Competition. The paper is also included in this section and has been expanded upon, now including an analysis of the outcomes of the students' reproducibility experiments. Lastly, this special section encapsulates a variety of advances in reproducibility in the SC conference series technical program.},
