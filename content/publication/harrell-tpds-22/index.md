abstract: In this special section we bring you a practice and experience effort in
  reproducibility for large-scale computational science at SC20. This section includes
  nine critiques, each by a student team that reproduced results from a paper published
  at SC19, during the following year's Student Cluster Competition. The paper is also
  included in this section and has been expanded upon, now including an analysis of
  the outcomes of the students' reproducibility experiments. Lastly, this special
  section encapsulates a variety of advances in reproducibility in the SC conference
  series technical program.
