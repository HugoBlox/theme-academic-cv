abstract: The response of glaciers to climate change has major implications for sea-level
  change and water resources around the globe. Large-scale glacier evolution models
  are used to project glacier runoff and mass loss, but are constrained by limited
  observations, which result in models being over-parameterized. Recent systematic
  geodetic mass-balance observations provide an opportunity to improve the calibration
  of glacier evolution models. In this study, we develop a calibration scheme for
  a glacier evolution model using a Bayesian inverse model and geodetic mass-balance
  observations, which enable us to quantify model parameter uncertainty. The Bayesian
  model is applied to each glacier in High Mountain Asia using Markov chain Monte
  Carlo methods. After 10,000 steps, the chains generate a sufficient number of independent
  samples to estimate the properties of the model parameters from the joint posterior
  distribution. Their spatial distribution shows a clear orographic effect indicating
  the resolution of climate data is too coarse to resolve temperature and precipitation
  at high altitudes. Given the glacier evolution model is over-parameterized, particular
  attention is given to identifiability and the need for future work to integrate
  additional observations in order to better constrain the plausible sets of model
  parameters.
