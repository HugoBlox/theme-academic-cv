abstract: 'Marine legislation is becoming more complex and marine ecosystem-based
  management is specified in national and regional legislative frameworks. Shelf-seas
  community and ecosystem models (hereafter termed ecosystem models) are central to
  the delivery of ecosystem-based management, but there is limited uptake and use
  of model products by decision makers in Europe and the UK in comparison with other
  countries. In this study, the challenges to the uptake and use of ecosystem models
  in support of marine environmental management are assessed using the UK capability
  as an example. The UK has a broad capability in marine ecosystem modelling, with
  at least 14 different models that support management, but few examples exist of
  ecosystem modelling that underpin policy or management decisions. To improve understanding
  of policy and management issues that can be addressed using ecosystem models, a
  workshop was convened that brought together advisors, assessors, biologists, social
  scientists, economists, modellers, statisticians, policy makers, and funders. Some
  policy requirements were identified that can be addressed without further model
  development including: attribution of environmental change to underlying drivers,
  integration of models and observations to develop more efficient monitoring programmes,
  assessment of indicator performance for different management goals, and the costs
  and benefit of legislation. Multi-model ensembles are being developed in cases where
  many models exist, but model structures are very diverse making a standardised approach
  of combining outputs a significant challenge, and there is a need for new methodologies
  for describing, analysing, and visualising uncertainties. A stronger link to social
  and economic systems is needed to increase the range of policy-related questions
  that can be addressed. It is also important to improve communication between policy
  and modelling communities so that there is a shared understanding of the strengths
  and limitations of ecosystem models.'
