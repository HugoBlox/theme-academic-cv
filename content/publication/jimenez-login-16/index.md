abstract: "Independently validating experimental results in the field of computer systems research is a challenging task. Recreating an environment that resembles the one where an experiment was originally executed is a time-consuming endeavor. In this article, we present Popper, a convention (or protocol) for conducting experiments following a DevOps approach that allows researchers to make all associated artifacts publicly available with the goal of maximizing automation in the re-execution of an experiment and validation of its results."
