abstract: Supraglacial ponds and ice cliffs can dramatically enhance ablation rates
  on debris-covered glaciers. Supraglacial ponds can also coalesce, forming moraine-dammed
  lakes at risk of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). Given Bhutanese glaciers have
  some of the highest ice loss rates in the Himalaya and GLOF vulnerability is high,
  we seek to advance our understanding of the spatial distribution and evolution of
  supraglacial ponds and ice cliffs. Here, we use high-resolution (3 m) Planet Labs
  satellite imagery to provide the first short-term, high-resolution dataset of supraglacial
  pond and ice cliff evolution for three glaciers along the Bhutan–Tibet border from
  2016 to 2018. A total of 5754 ponds and 2088 ice cliffs were identified. Large intra-annual
  changes were observed, with ponded area changes and drainage events coinciding with
  the seasonality of the Indian Summer Monsoon. On average, ~19% of the total number
  of ponds had a coincident ice cliff. Pond spatial distribution was driven by ice-surface
  velocities, with higher numbers of ponds found in areas of low velocity (textless8
  m a−1). Our study provides the first detailed, quantitative investigation of supraglacial
  ponds and ice cliffs in Bhutan, providing a framework for further monitoring in
  this understudied, yet important, region of the Himalaya.
