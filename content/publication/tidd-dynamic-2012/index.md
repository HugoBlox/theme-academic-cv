abstract: A discrete choice model is applied to determine how fishing effort is allocated
  spatially and temporally by the English and Welsh North Sea beam trawl fleet. Individual
  vessels can fish in five distinct areas, and the utility of fishing in an area depends
  on expected revenue measured as previous success (value per unit effort) and experience
  (past fishing effort allocation), as well as perceived costs (measured as distance
  to landing port weighted by fuel price). The model predicts fisher location choice,
  and the predictions are evaluated using iterative partial cross validation by fitting
  the model over a series of separate time-periods (nine separate time-periods). Results
  show the relative importance of the different drivers that change over time. They
  indicate that there are three main drivers throughout the study, past annual effort,
  past monthly effort in the year of fishing, and fuel price, largely reflecting the
  fact that previous practices where success was gained are learned (i.e. experience)
  and become habitual, and that seasonal variations also dominate behaviour in terms
  of the strong monthly trends and variable costs. In order to provide an indication
  of the model's predictive capabilities, a simulated closure of one of the study
  areas was undertaken (an area that mapped reasonably well with the North Sea cod
  2001 partial closure of the North Sea for 10 weeks of that year). The predicted
  reallocation of effort was compared against realized/observed reallocation of effort,
  and there was good correlation at the trip level, with a maximum 10% misallocation
  of predicted effort for that year.
