abstract: We present the first application of the Snow Covered Area and Grain size
  model (SCAG) to the Visible Infrared imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and assess
  these retrievals with finer‐resolution fractional snow cover maps from Landsat 8
  Operational Land Imager (OLI). Because Landsat 8 OLI avoids saturation issues common
  to Landsat 1–7 in the visible wavelengths, we re-assess the accuracy of the SCAG
  fractional snow cover maps from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
  that were previously evaluated using data from earlier Landsat sensors. Use of the
  fractional snow cover maps from Landsat 8 OLI shows a negative bias of −0.5% for
  MODSCAG and −1.3% for VIIRSCAG, whereas previous MODSCAG evaluations found a bias
  of −7.6% in the Himalaya. We find similar root mean squared error (RMSE) values
  of 0.133 and 0.125 for MODIS and VIIRS, respectively. The Recall statistic (probability
  of detection) for cells with more than 15% snow cover in this challenging steep
  topography was found to be 0.90 for both MODSCAG and VIIRSCAG, significantly higher
  than previous evaluations based on Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and 7 Enhanced
  Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). In addition, daily retrievals from MODIS and VIIRS
  are consistent across gradients of elevation, slope, and aspect. Different native
  resolutions of the gridded products at 1 km and 500 m for VIIRS and MODIS, respectively,
  result in snow cover maps showing a slightly different distribution of values with
  VIIRS having more mixed pixels and MODIS having 7% more pure snow pixels. Despite
  the resolution differences, the snow maps from both sensors produce similar total
  snow-covered areas and snow-line elevations in this region, with R2 values of 0.98
  and 0.88, respectively. We find that the SCAG algorithm performs consistently across
  various spatial resolutions and that fractional snow cover maps from the VIIRS instruments
  aboard Suomi NPP, JPPS–1, and JPPS–2 can be a suitable replacement as MODIS sensors
  reach their ends of life.
