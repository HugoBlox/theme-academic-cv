abstract: Climate change effects on marine ecosystems include impacts on primary production,
  ocean temperature, species distributions, and abundance at local to global scales.
  These changes will significantly alter marine ecosystem structure and function with
  associated socio-economic impacts on ecosystem services, marine fisheries, and fishery-dependent
  societies. Yet how these changes may play out among ocean basins over the 21st century
  remains unclear, with most projections coming from single ecosystem models that
  do not adequately capture the range of model uncertainty. We address this by using
  six marine ecosystem models within the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison
  Project (Fish-MIP) to analyze responses of marine animal biomass in all major ocean
  basins to contrasting climate change scenarios. Under a high emissions scenario
  (RCP8.5), total marine animal biomass declined by an ensemble mean of 15%–30% (±12%–17%)
  in the North and South Atlantic and Pacific, and the Indian Ocean by 2100, whereas
  polar ocean basins experienced a 20%–80% (±35%–200%) increase. Uncertainty and model
  disagreement were greatest in the Arctic and smallest in the South Pacific Ocean.
  Projected changes were reduced under a low (RCP2.6) emissions scenario. Under RCP2.6
  and RCP8.5, biomass projections were highly correlated with changes in net primary
  production and negatively correlated with projected sea surface temperature increases
  across all ocean basins except the polar oceans. Ecosystem structure was projected
  to shift as animal biomass concentrated in different size-classes across ocean basins
  and emissions scenarios. We highlight that climate change mitigation measures could
  moderate the impacts on marine animal biomass by reducing biomass declines in the
  Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean basins. The range of individual model projections
  emphasizes the importance of using an ensemble approach in assessing uncertainty
  of future change.
