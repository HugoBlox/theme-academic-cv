abstract: "As storage devices get faster, data management tasks rob the host of CPU cycles and DDR bandwidth. In this article, we examine a new interface to storage devices that can leverage existing and new CPU and DRAM resources to take over data management tasks like availability, recovery, and migrations. This new interface provides a roadmap for device-to-device interactions and more powerful storage devices capable of providing in-store compute services that can dramatically improve performance. We call such storage devices ``eusocial'' because we are inspired by eusocial insects like ants, termites, and bees, which as individuals are primitive but collectively accomplish amazing things."
