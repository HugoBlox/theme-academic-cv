abstract: Abstract   Background  Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type
  of primary brain tumor, as most patients succumb to the disease less than two years
  after diagnosis. Critically, studies demonstrate that glioma recruits surrounding
  blood vessels, while some work suggests that tumor stem cells themselves directly
  differentiate into endothelial cells, yet the molecular and cellular dynamics of
  the endothelium in glioma are poorly characterized. The goal of this study was to
  establish molecular and morphological benchmarks for tumor associated vessels (TAVs)
  and tumor derived endothelial cells (TDECs) during glioblastoma progression.    Methods  Using
  In-Utero Electroporation and CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to generate a native,
  immunocompetent mouse model of glioma, we characterized vascular-tumor dynamics
  in three dimensions during tumor progression. We employed bulk and single-cell RNA-Sequencing
  to elucidate the relationship between TAVs and TDECs. We confirmed our findings
  in a patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model.    Results  Using a mouse
  model of glioma, we identified progressive alteration of vessel function and morphogenesis
  over time. We also showed in our mouse model that TDECs are a rare subpopulation
  that contributes to vessels within the tumor, albeit to a limited degree. Furthermore,
  transcriptional profiling demonstrates that both TAVs and TDECs are molecularly
  distinct, and both populations feature extensive molecular heterogeneity. Finally,
  the distinct molecular signatures of these heterogeneous populations are also present
  in human glioma.    Conclusions  Our findings show extensive endothelial heterogeneity
  within the tumor and tumor microenvironment and provide insights into the diverse
  cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive glioma vascularization and angiogenesis
  during tumorigenesis.
