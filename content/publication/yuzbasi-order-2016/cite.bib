 abstract = {Abstract

In this study,
pf
and
df
of single order statistic of nonidentical discrete random variables are obtained. These functions are also expressed in integral form. Finally,
pf
and
df
of extreme of order statistics of random variables for the nonidentical discrete case are given.},
