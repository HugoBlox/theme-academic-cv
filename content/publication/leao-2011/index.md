abstract: This article presents a methodology for conceiving and planning the development
  of an optimized supply chain of a biodiesel plant sourced from family farms and
  taking into consideration agricultural, logistic, industrial, and social aspects.
  This model was successfully applied to the production chain of biodiesel fuel from
  castor oil in the semi-arid region of Brazil. Results suggest important insights
  related to the optimal configuration of the crushing units, regarding its location,
  technology, and when it should be available, as well as the configuration of the
  production zones along the planning horizon considered. Moreover, a sensitivity
  analysis is performed in order to measure how possible variations in the considered
  conjecture can affect the robustness of the solutions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
