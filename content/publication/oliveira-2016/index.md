abstract: Operational decisions for crude oil scheduling activities are determined
  on a daily basis and have a strong impact on the overall supply chain cost. The
  challenge is to develop a feasible schedule at a low cost that has a high level
  of confidence. This paper presents a framework to support decision making in terminal-refinery
  systems under supply uncertainty. The proposed framework comprises a stochastic
  optimization model based on mixed-integer linear programming for scheduling a crude
  oil pipeline connecting a marine terminal to an oil refinery and a method for representing
  oil supply uncertainty. The scenario generation method aims at generating a minimal
  number of scenarios while preserving as much as possible of the uncertainty characteristics.
  The proposed framework was evaluated considering real-world data. The numerical
  results suggest the efficiency of the framework in providing resilient solutions
  in terms of feasibility in the face of the inherent uncertainty.
