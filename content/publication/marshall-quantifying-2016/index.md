abstract: 'To understand changes in ecosystems, the appropriate scale at which to
  study them must be determined. Large marine ecosystems (LMEs) cover thousands of
  square kilometres and are a useful classification scheme for ecosystem monitoring
  and assessment. However, averaging across LMEs may obscure intricate dynamics within.
  The purpose of this study is to mathematically determine local and regional patterns
  of ecological change within an LME using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs).
  After using EOFs to define regions with distinct patterns of change, a statistical
  model originating from control theory is applied (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving
  Average with eXogenous input - NARMAX) to assess potential drivers of change within
  these regions. We have selected spatial data sets (0.5° latitude × 1°longitude)
  of fish abundance from North Sea fisheries research surveys (spanning 1980-2008)
  as well as of temperature, oxygen, net primary production and a fishing pressure
  proxy, to which we apply the EOF and NARMAX methods. Two regions showed significant
  changes since 1980: the central North Sea displayed a decrease in community size
  structure which the NARMAX model suggested was linked to changes in fishing; and
  the Norwegian trench region displayed an increase in community size structure which,
  as indicated by NARMAX results, was primarily linked to changes in sea-bottom temperature.
  These regions were compared to an area of no change along the eastern Scottish coast
  where the model determined the community size structure was most strongly associated
  to net primary production. This study highlights the multifaceted effects of environmental
  change and fishing pressures in different regions of the North Sea. Furthermore,
  by highlighting this spatial heterogeneity in community size structure change, important
  local spatial dynamics are often overlooked when the North Sea is considered as
  a broad-scale, homogeneous ecosystem (as normally is the case within the political
  Marine Strategy Framework Directive).'
