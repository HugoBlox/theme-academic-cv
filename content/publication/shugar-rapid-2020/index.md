abstract: Glacial lakes are rapidly growing in response to climate change and glacier
  retreat. The role of these lakes as terrestrial storage for glacial meltwater is
  currently unknown and not accounted for in global sea level assessments. Here, we
  map glacier lakes around the world using 254,795 satellite images and use scaling
  relations to estimate that global glacier lake volume increased by around 48%, to
  156.5 km3, between 1990 and 2018. This methodology provides a near-global database
  and analysis of glacial lake extent, volume and change. Over the study period, lake
  numbers and total area increased by 53 and 51%, respectively. Median lake size has
  increased 3%; however, the 95th percentile has increased by around 9%. Currently,
  glacial lakes hold about 0.43 mm of sea level equivalent. As glaciers continue to
  retreat and feed glacial lakes, the implications for glacial lake outburst floods
  and water resources are of considerable societal and ecological importance.
