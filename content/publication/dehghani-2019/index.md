abstract: The main objective when managing inventories in blood supply chains is to
  establish an efficient balance between the wastage and shortage of blood units.
  The uncertain demand and the perishable nature of blood units can result in over-
  or under-stocking and increase wastage and shortage costs. In this study, we analyze
  how a proactive transshipment policy can avoid future shortages in addition to mitigate
  wastage. We consider a network of hospitals with uncertain demand in which each
  hospital makes decisions on the quantity to order from a central blood bank and
  to transship to other hospitals in each review period. We formulate the problem
  as a two-stage stochastic programming model. To generate scenarios, the Quasi-Monte
  Carlo sampling approach is employed and the optimal number of scenarios is determined
  by conducting stability tests. We performed numerical experiments to evaluate the
  performance of the proposed model and investigate the potential benefits of the
  outlined proactive transshipment. The developed model is used to compare the optimized
  policy with the current practice in some hospitals in Australia and with a no-transshipment
  policy. The numerical results indicate significant potential cost savings in comparison
  with the current policy in use and the no-transshipment policy.
