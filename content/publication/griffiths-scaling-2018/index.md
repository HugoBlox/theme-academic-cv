abstract: "Understanding how, where, and when animals move is a central problem in\
  \ marine ecology and conservation. Key to improving our knowledge about what drives\
  \ animal movement is the rising deployment of telemetry devices on a range of free-roaming\
  \ species. An increasingly popular way of gaining meaningful inference from an animal's\
  \ recorded movements is the application of hidden Markov models (HMMs), which allow\
  \ for the identification of latent behavioral states in the movement paths of individuals.\
  \ However, the use of HMMs to explore the population-level consequences of movement\
  \ is often limited by model complexity and insufficient sample sizes. Here, we introduce\
  \ an alternative approach to current practices and provide evidence of how the inclusion\
  \ of prior information in model structure can simplify the application of HMMs to\
  \ multiple animal movement paths with two clear benefits: (a) consistent state allocation\
  \ and (b) increases in effective sample size. To demonstrate the utility of our\
  \ approach, we apply HMMs and adapted HMMs to over 100 multivariate movement paths\
  \ consisting of conditionally dependent daily horizontal and vertical movements\
  \ in two species of demersal fish: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua; n = 46) and European\
  \ plaice (Pleuronectes platessa; n = 61). We identify latent states corresponding\
  \ to two main underlying behaviors: resident and migrating. As our analysis considers\
  \ a relatively large sample size and states are allocated consistently, we use collective\
  \ model output to investigate state-dependent spatiotemporal trends at the individual\
  \ and population levels. In particular, we show how both species shift their movement\
  \ behaviors on a seasonal basis and demonstrate population space use patterns that\
  \ are consistent with previous individual-level studies. Tagging studies are increasingly\
  \ being used to inform stock assessment models, spatial management strategies, and\
  \ monitoring of marine fish populations. Our approach provides a promising way of\
  \ adding value to tagging studies because inferences about movement behavior can\
  \ be gained from a larger proportion of datasets, making tagging studies more relevant\
  \ to management and more cost-effective."
