abstract: We present deterministic and stochastic programming models for the workover
  rig problem, one of the most challenging problems in the oil industry. In the deterministic
  approach, an integer linear programming model is used to determine the rig fleet
  size and schedule needed to service wells while maximizing oil production and minimizing
  rig usage cost. The stochastic approach is an extension of the deterministic method
  and relies on a two-stage stochastic programming model to define the optimal rig
  fleet size considering uncertainty in the intervention time. In this approach, different
  scenario-generation methods are compared. Several experiments were performed using
  instances based on real-world problems. The results suggest that the proposed methodology
  can be used to solve large instances and produces quality solutions in computationally
  reasonable times.
