abstract: In this paper, we apply shrinkage strategies to estimate regression coefficients
  efficiently for the high-dimensional multiple regression model, where the number
  of samples is smaller than the number of predictors. We assume in the sparse linear
  model some of the predictors have very weak influence on the response of interest.
  We propose to shrink estimators more than usual. Specifically, we use integrated
  estimation strategies in sub and full models and shrink the integrated estimators
  by incorporating a bounded measurable function of some weights. The exhibited double
  shrunken estimators improve the prediction performance of sub models significantly
  selected from existing Lasso-type variable selection methods. Monte Carlo simulation
  studies as well as real examples of eye data and Riboavin data confirm the superior
  performance of the estimators in the high-dimensional regression model.
