abstract: 'A recent publication about balanced harvesting (Froese et al., ICES Journal
  of Marine Science; 73: 1640–1650) contains several erroneous statements about size-spectrum
  models. We refute the statements by showing that the assumptions pertaining to size-spectrum
  models discussed by Froese et al. are realistic and consistent. We further show
  that the assumption about density-dependence being described by a stock recruitment
  relationship is responsible for determining whether a peak in the cohort biomass
  of a population occurs late or early in life. Finally, we argue that there is indeed
  a constructive role for a wide suite of ecosystem models to evaluate ﬁshing strategies
  in an ecosystem context.'
