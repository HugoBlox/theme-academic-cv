abstract: As our global climate warms, people and economies utilizing water resources
  sourced by snow and ice melt in mountain areas are disproportionately affected relative
  to locations that rely on rainfall. Worldwide, the vast majority of those impacted
  by snowfall changing to rainfall and earlier melt from a warming climate live in
  Asia. The Brahmaputra River originates in the declining glaciers and snowfields
  of the Chinese and Bhutanese Himalaya before flowing to the mega population centers
  of the Bangladesh delta. Bhutanâ€™s economy relies on water resource-dependent hydropower
  and agriculture imposing important questions about the impact of climate change
  on the long-term viability of these important economic sectors. To clarify potential
  effects on water supplies in a warming world, and specifically to quantify the role
  of meltwater to river discharge in the headwaters of the Brahmaputra basin, we utilize
  a combined field observation-remote sensing approach to quantify river discharge
  source waters in a representative headwater basin, the Chamkhar Chhu. Using four
  years of water isotope and chemistry data together with a Bayesian Monte Carlo mixing
  model run seasonally in 2016, we find that the Chamkhar Chhu is mostly a rain-dominated
  basin at the lower elevation of our study domain (2591 m a.s.l.), with peak contributions
  from snowmelt in the early-monsoon and ice melt in the post-monsoon seasons. The
  radioactive tritium isotope shows glacier ice at the terminus was formed before
  the 1960s bomb spike while late monsoon groundwater and river water samples are
  sourced from mostly newer water inputs. An overall decreasing trend in the minimum
  snow and ice cover extent maps produced using MODIS Terra data from 2000-2017 suggest
  a lessening of cryospheric water resource availability in the basin, although this
  time series is short compared to the timescale of atmospheric-oceanic oscillations
  controlling snowfall. While decreasing snow and ice resources will likely lead to
  changing melt water contributions to river discharge, the overall impact on the
  water resources may be buffered by rainfall contributions as previous studies forecast
  an increase in precipitation for the region that will likely make up for lower melt
  water inputs.
