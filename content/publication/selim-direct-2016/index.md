abstract: Humanity depends on the marine environment for a range of vital ecosystem
  services, at global (e.g. climate regulation), regional (e.g. commercial fisheries)
  and local scales (e.g. coastal defence and recreation). At the same time, marine
  ecosystems have been exploited for centuries, and many systems today are under stress
  from multiple sources. Recent studies have shown how both climate change and fishing
  have caused long-term changes in the marine environment. However, there is still
  poor understanding of how these changes influence change in coastal ecosystem services.
  In this paper, an integrated modelling approach is used to assess how the final
  delivery of marine ecosystem services to coastal communities is influenced by the
  direct and indirect effects of changes in ecosystem processes brought about by climate
  and human impacts, using fisheries of the North Sea region as a case study. Partial
  least squares path analysis is used to explore the relationships between drivers
  of change, marine ecosystem processes and services (landings). A simple conceptual
  model with four variables—climate, fishing effort, ecosystem process and ecosystem
  services—is applied to the English North Sea using historic ecological, climatic
  and fisheries time series spanning 1924–2010 to identify the multiple pathways that
  might exist. As expected, direct and indirect links between fishing effort, ecosystem
  processes and service provision were significant. However, links between climate
  and ecosystem processes were weak. This paper highlights how path analysis can be
  used for analysing long-term temporal links between ecosystem processes and services
  following a simplified pathway.
