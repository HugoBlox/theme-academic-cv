abstract: 'Policy- and decision-makers require assessments of status and trends for
  marine species, habitats, and ecosystems to understand if human activities in the
  marine environment are sustainable, particularly in the face of global change. Central
  to many assessments are statistical and dynamical models of populations, communities,
  ecosystems, and their socioeconomic systems and management frameworks. The establishment
  of a national system that could facilitate the development of such model-based assessments
  has been identified as a priority for addressing management challenges for Australia’s
  marine environment. Given that most assessments require cross-scale information,
  individual models cannot capture all of the spatial, temporal, biological, and socioeconomic
  scales that are typically needed. Coupling or integrating models across scales and
  domains can expand the scope for developing comprehensive and internally consistent,
  system-level assessments, including higher-level feedbacks in social–ecological
  systems. In this article, we summarize: (i) integrated modelling for marine systems
  currently being undertaken in Australia, (ii) methods used for integration and comparison
  of models, and (iii) improvements to facilitate further integration, particularly
  with respect to standards and specifications. We consider future needs for integrated
  modelling of marine social–ecological systems in Australia and provide a set of
  recommendations for priority focus areas in the development of a national approach
  to integrated modelling. These recommendations draw on—and have broader relevance
  for—international efforts around integrated modelling to inform decision-making
  for marine systems.'
