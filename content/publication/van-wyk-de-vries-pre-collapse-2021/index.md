  On the 7th of February 2021, a large rock-ice avalanche triggered a debris flow
  in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, India, leaving over 200 dead or missing. The rock-ice
  avalanche originated from a steep, glacierized north-facing slope. In this work,
  we assess the precursory signs exhibited by this slope prior to the catastrophic
  collapse. We evaluate monthly slope motion from 2015 to 2021 through feature tracking
  of high-resolution optical satellite imagery. We then combine these data with a
  time series of pre- and post-event DEMs, which we use to evaluate elevation change
  over the same area. Both datasets show that the 26.9&thinsp;Mm$^textrm3$ collapse
  block moved over 10&thinsp;m horizontally and vertically in the five years preceding
  collapse, with particularly rapid motion occurring in the summers of 2017 and 2018.
  We propose that the collapse results from a combination of snow-loading in a deep
  headwall crack and permafrost degradation in the heavily jointed bedrock. Our observation
  of a clear precursory signal highlights the potential of satellite imagery for monitoring
  the stability of high-risk slopes. We find that the timing of the Chamoli rock-ice
  avalanche could likely not have been forecast from satellite data alone.textless/ptextgreater
