abstract: Seasonal variability of the global hydrologic cycle directly impacts human
  activities, including hazard assessment and mitigation, agricultural decisions,
  and water resources management. This is particularly true across the High Mountain
  Asia (HMA) region, where water resource needs change depending on the seasonality
  and intensity of the hydrologic cycle. Forecasting the atmospheric states and surface
  conditions, including hydrometeorological relevant variables, at subseasonal-to-seasonal
  (S2S) lead times of weeks-to-months is an area of active research and development.
  NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) S2S prediction system has been
  developed with this research goal in mind. Here, we benchmark the forecast skill
  of GEOS-S2S (version 2) seasonal hydrometeorological forecasts in the HMA region,
  including a portion of the Indian Subcontinent, at 1-, 2-, and 3-month lead times
  during the retrospective forecast period, 1981&ndash;2016. To assess forecast skill,
  we evaluate 2-m air temperature, total precipitation, fractional snow cover, snow
  water equivalent, surface soil moisture, and terrestrial water storage forecasts
  against MERRA-2 and independent reanalysis, satellite observations, and data fusion
  products. Anomaly correlation is highest when the forecasts are evaluated against
  MERRA-2 and especially in variables with long memory in the climate system, possibly
  due to similar initial conditions and model architecture used in GEOS-S2S and MERRA-2.
  When compared to MERRA-2, results for the 1-month forecast skill ranges from anomaly
  correlation of R$_textrmanom$=0.18 for precipitation to R$_textrmanom$=0.62 for
  soil moisture. Anomaly correlations are persistently lower when forecasts are evaluated
  against independent observations; results for the 1-month forecast skill ranges
  from R$_textrmanom$=0.13 for snow water equivalent to R$_textrmanom$=0.24 for fractional
  snow cover. Hydrometeorological forecast skill is dependent on the forecast lead
  time, the memory of the variable within the physical system, and the validation
  dataset used. Overall, these results benchmark the GEOS-S2S system&rsquo;s ability
  to forecast HMA hydrometeorology on the seasonal timescale.
