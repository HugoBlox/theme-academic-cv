abstract: "Do large-scale industrial fisheries for sandeels impact 'human consumption'\
  \ fishes by depriving them of food? In the North Sea, most sandeel fishing takes\
  \ place on the Dogger Bank during spring. Here, we studied sandeel-fishery and sandeel-predatory\
  \ fish interactions in 2 sampling grids, focussing on (1) how localised sandeels\
  \ are distributed during the day (when feeding pelagically) and at night (when buried\
  \ in the seabed); (2) how precisely the fishery can target localised sandeel concentrations;\
  \ and (3) how tightly day/night sandeel distributions are linked to the local abundance\
  \ of predatory fishes and their sandeel consumption. Sandeel abundance differed\
  \ widely between both grids. Within each grid, marked day/night differences in distributions\
  \ indicated extensive diurnal migrations, with centres of gravity of day and night\
  \ distributions up to 15 km apart. Fishing effort was tightly matched with sandeel\
  \ populations during the day and was far higher in the 'high sandeel density' grid.\
  \ Only at the finest scale examined, effort was concentrated at sandbanks but not\
  \ significantly matched with local sandeel numbers. This suggested either insufficient\
  \ knowledge among fishers or vessel maneuverability issues, possibly relating to\
  \ high mobility of sandeels. Ten predatory fishes (8 'human consumption' species)\
  \ preyed on sandeels, most notably whiting and lesser weever. Spatial comparisons\
  \ showed that the predominant sandeel predators were whiting during the day and\
  \ lesser weever at night. Tight predator-prey interdependencies were revealed: whiting\
  \ and weever exhibited 'aggregative responses' to sandeels, and most predators consumed\
  \ more sandeels in the 'high sandeel density' grid. On the Dogger Bank, sandeel\
  \ fishing effort is concentrated when and where sandeels are most available, but\
  \ also where these are extensively and locally preyed upon by at least 10 predatory\
  \ fish species. Hence concerns that this industrial fishery may indirectly impact\
  \ predatory fishes by depriving them of food might have some basis."
