abstract: Accurate information on the growth rates of fish is crucial for fisheries
  stock assessment and management. Empirical life history parameters (von Bertalanffy
  growth) are widely fitted to cross-sectional size-at-age data sampled from fish
  populations. This method often assumes that environmental factors affecting growth
  remain constant over time. The current study utilized longitudinal life history
  information contained in otoliths from 412 juveniles and adults of gilthead seabream,
  Sparus aurata, a commercially important species fished and farmed throughout the
  Mediterranean. Historical annual growth rates over 11 consecutive years (2002â€“2012)
  in the Gulf of Lions (NW Mediterranean) were reconstructed to investigate the effect
  of temperature variations on the annual growth of this fish. S. aurata growth was
  modelled linearly as the relationship between otolith size at year t against otolith
  size at the previous year t-1. The effect of temperature on growth was modelled
  with linear mixed effects models and a simplified linear model to be implemented
  in a cohort Integral Projection Model (cIPM). The cIPM was used to project S. aurata
  growth, year to year, under different temperature scenarios. Our results determined
  current increasing summer temperatures to have a negative effect on S. aurata annual
  growth in the Gulf of Lions. They suggest that global warming already has and will
  further have a significant impact on S. aurata size-at-age, with important implications
  for age-structured stock assessments and reference points used in fisheries.
