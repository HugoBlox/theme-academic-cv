abstract: 'Understanding how ecological communities are structured and how this may
  vary between different types of ecosystems is a fundamental question in ecology.
  We develop a general framework for quantifying size-structure within and among different
  ecosystem types (e.g. terrestrial, freshwater or marine), via the use of a suite
  of bivariate relationships between organismal size and properties of individuals,
  populations, assemblages, pair-wise interactions, and network topology. Each of
  these relationships can be considered a dimension of size-structure, along which
  real communities lie on a continuous scale. For example, the strength, slope, or
  elevation of the body mass-versus-abundance or predator size-versus-prey size relationships
  may vary systematically among ecosystem types. We draw on examples from the literature
  and suggest new ways to use allometries for comparing among ecosystem types, which
  we illustrate by applying them to published data. Finally, we discuss how dimensions
  of size-structure are interconnected and how we could approach this complex hierarchy
  systematically. We conclude: (1) there are multiple dimensions of size-structure;
  (2) communities may be size-structured in some of these dimensions, but not necessarily
  in others; (3) across-system comparisons via rigorous quantitative statistical methods
  are possible, and (4) insufficient data are currently available to illuminate thoroughly
  the full extent and nature of differences in size-structure among ecosystem types.'
