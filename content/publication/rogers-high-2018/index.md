abstract: Refuge availability and fishing alter predator-prey interactions on coral
  reefs, but our understanding of how they interact to drive food web dynamics, community
  structure and vulnerability of different trophic groups is unclear. Here, we apply
  a size-based ecosystem model of coral reefs, parameterized with empirical measures
  of structural complexity, to predict fish biomass, productivity and community structure
  in reef ecosystems under a broad range of refuge availability and fishing regimes.
  In unfished ecosystems, the expected positive correlation between reef structural
  complexity and biomass emerges, but a non-linear effect of predation refuges is
  observed for the productivity of predatory fish. Reefs with intermediate complexity
  have the highest predator productivity, but when refuge availability is high and
  prey are less available, predator growth rates decrease, with significant implications
  for fisheries. Specifically, as fishing intensity increases, predators in habitats
  with high refuge availability exhibit vulnerability to over-exploitation, resulting
  in communities dominated by herbivores. Our study reveals mechanisms for threshold
  dynamics in predators living in complex habitats and elucidates how predators can
  be food-limited when most of their prey are able to hide. We also highlight the
  importance of nutrient recycling via the detrital pathway, to support high predator
  biomasses on coral reefs.
