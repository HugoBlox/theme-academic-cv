  Model intercomparison studies in the climate and Earth sciences communities have
  been crucial to building credibility and coherence for future projections. They
  have quantified variability among models, spurred model development, contrasted
  within- and among-model uncertainty, assessed model fits to historical data, and
  provided ensemble projections of future change under specified scenarios. Given
  the speed and magnitude of anthropogenic change in the marine environment and the
  consequent effects on food security, biodiversity, marine industries, and society,
  the time is ripe for similar comparisons among models of fisheries and marine ecosystems.
  Here, we describe the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project
  protocol version 1.0 (Fish-MIP v1.0), part of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison
  Project (ISIMIP), which is a cross-sectoral network of climate impact modellers.
  Given the complexity of the marine ecosystem, this class of models has substantial
  heterogeneity of purpose, scope, theoretical underpinning, processes considered,
  parameterizations, resolution (grain size), and spatial extent. This heterogeneity
  reflects the lack of a unified understanding of the marine ecosystem and implies
  that the assemblage of all models is more likely to include a greater number of
  relevant processes than any single model. The current Fish-MIP protocol is designed
  to allow these heterogeneous models to be forced with common Earth System Model
  (ESM) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) outputs under prescribed
  scenarios for historic (from the 1950s) and future (to 2100) time periods; it will
  be adapted to CMIP phase 6 (CMIP6) in future iterations. It also describes a standardized
  set of outputs for each participating Fish-MIP model to produce. This enables the
  broad characterization of differences between and uncertainties within models and
  projections when assessing climate and fisheries impacts on marine ecosystems and
  the services they provide. The systematic generation, collation, and comparison
  of results from Fish-MIP will inform an understanding of the range of plausible
  changes in marine ecosystems and improve our capacity to define and convey the strengths
  and weaknesses of model-based advice on future states of marine ecosystems and fisheries.
  Ultimately, Fish-MIP represents a step towards bringing together the marine ecosystem
  modelling community to produce consistent ensemble medium- and long-term projections
  of marine ecosystems.textless/ptextgreater
