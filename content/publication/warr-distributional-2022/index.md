abstract: The high mountain regions of Asia contain more glacial ice than anywhere
  on the planet outside of the polar regions. Because of the large population living
  in the Indus watershed region who are reliant on melt from these glaciers for fresh
  water, understanding the factors that affect glacial melt along with the impacts
  of climate change on the region is important for managing these natural resources.
  While there are multiple climate data products (e.g., reanalysis and global climate
  models) available to study the impact of climate change on this region, each product
  will have a different amount of skill in projecting a given climate variable, such
  as precipitation. In this research, we develop a spatially varying mixture model
  to compare the distribution of precipitation in the High Mountain Asia region as
  produced by climate models with the corresponding distribution from in situ observations
  from the Asian Precipitation—Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards
  Evaluation (APHRODITE) data product. Parameter estimation is carried out via a computationally
  efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Each of the estimated climate distributions
  from each climate data product is then validated against APHRODITE using a spatially
  varying Kullback–Leibler divergence measure. Supplementary materials accompanying
  this paper appear online.
