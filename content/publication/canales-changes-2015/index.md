abstract: Size-based indicators are important tools for understanding how environmental
  variability and fishing impact on marine populations and communities. Ideally, they
  would standardise fishery-independent survey data. However, this is not possible
  in many of the world's ecosystems with important commercial fisheries. Using fishery-dependent
  data we investigated changes in the sizeâ€“structure of pelagic catches off Northern
  Chile and whether or not these changes are influenced by the environment. We computed
  single- and multispecies, size-based fishery indicators (SBFIs) from 1990 to 2008
  for the main commercial species, anchovy (Engraulis ringens), sardine (Sardinops
  sagax), jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi) and mackerel (Scomber japonicus). SBFIs
  indicated a downward trend of body size in the catches taking all species together;
  a decrease of large sardine, an increase of small jack mackerel together with a
  decrease of larger sizes. Anchovy remained stable in body size and catch per unit
  of effort over the time period. Significant effects of the environment on mean length
  and catch per unit of effort were found for anchovy and sardine, respectively. We
  conclude that catches of pelagic species have shifted to smaller body sizes, with
  anchovy becoming the dominant species in the catches. We discuss the changes in
  the context of simultaneous, long-term, climate variability and fishing mortality.
