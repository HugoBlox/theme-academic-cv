abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the status and changes in glacier length
  (since the 1850s), area and mass (since the 1960s) along the Himalayan-Karakoram
  (HK) region and their climate-change context. A quantitative reliability classification
  of the field-based mass-balance series is developed. Glaciological mass balances
  agree better with remotely sensed balances when we make an objective, systematic
  exclusion of likely flawed mass-balance series. The Himalayan mean glaciological
  mass budget was similar to the global average until 2000, and likely less negative
  after 2000. Mass wastage in the Himalaya resulted in increasing debris cover, the
  growth of glacial lakes and possibly decreasing ice velocities. Geodetic measurements
  indicate nearly balanced mass budgets for Karakoram glaciers since the 1970s, consistent
  with the unchanged extent of supraglacial debris-cover. Himalayan glaciers seem
  to be sensitive to precipitation partly through the albedo feedback on the short-wave
  radiation balance. Melt contributions from HK glaciers should increase until 2050
  and then decrease, though a wide range of present-day area and volume estimates
  propagates large uncertainties in the future runoff. This review reflects an increasing
  understanding of HK glaciers and highlights the remaining challenges.
