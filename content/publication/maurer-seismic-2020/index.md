abstract: Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are a substantial hazard for downstream
  communities in vulnerable regions, yet unpredictable triggers and remote source
  locations make GLOF dynamics difficult to measure and quantify. Here, we revisit
  a destructive GLOF that occurred in Bhutan in 1994 and apply cross-correlationâ€“based
  seismic analyses to track the evolution of the GLOF remotely (~100 kilometers from
  the source region). We use the seismic observations along with eyewitness reports
  and a downstream gauge station to constrain a numerical flood model and then assess
  geomorphic change and current state of the unstable lakes via satellite imagery.
  Coherent seismic energy is evident from 1 to 5 hertz beginning approximately 5 hours
  before the flood impacted Punakha village, which originated at the source lake and
  advanced down the valley during the GLOF duration. Our analysis highlights potential
  benefits of using real-time seismic monitoring to improve early warning systems.
  Remote seismic observations of a glacial lake outburst flood highlight potential
  for improving early warning systems. Remote seismic observations of a glacial lake
  outburst flood highlight potential for improving early warning systems.
