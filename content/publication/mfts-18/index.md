# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "During the recent years, connected automated vehicles (CAV) have shown to be a crucial technology for the upcoming developments towards the improvement of traffic conditions. Considerable efforts have been concentrated in the development of automated strategies for longitudinal formation, a.k.a. cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), where inter-vehicle distance can be shortened, in order to maximize network flow and improve fuel efficiency. Nevertheless, one challenge prevailing in the design of such strategies is their robustness and flexibility to a variety of network configurations and traffic conditions, which implies CAV platoons should allow active platooning manoeuvers such as split, merge, join according to interactions with conventional vehicles in the network."
abstract_short = "This work presents an initial approach for multiple-merging strategies of platoons at network discontinuities."
