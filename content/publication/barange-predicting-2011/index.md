abstract: 'Climate change is accelerating and is already affecting the marine environment.
  Estimating the effects of climate change on the production of fish resources, and
  their dependent societies, is complex because of: difficulties of downscaling Global
  Climate Models (GCM) to scales of biological relevance; uncertainties over future
  net primary production and its transfer through the food chain; difficulties in
  separating the multiple stressors affecting fish production; and inadequate methodology
  to estimate human vulnerabilities to these changes. QUEST_Fish, a research project
  led from the UK, is addressing some of these challenges through an innovative, multi-disciplinary
  approach focused on estimating the added impacts that climate change is likely to
  cause, and the subsequent additional risks and vulnerabilities of these effects
  for human societies. The project uses coupled shelf seas biophysical ecosystem models
  forced by GCM forecasts to predict ecosystem functioning in past, present, and future
  time-slices. For each slice, and for 20 Large Marine Ecosystems, we estimate plankton
  production and use this to estimate size-based fish production through models based
  on macro-ecological theory. Ways of assessing vulnerability of fisheries to future
  climate change are developed, including the market consequences for fish-based global
  commodities. The results provide a new framework and new insights into the complex
  interactions between humans and nature.'
