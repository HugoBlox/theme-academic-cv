abstract: 'High-Mountain Asia exhibits one of the highest increases in vegetation
  greenness on Earth, subsequently influencing the exchange of water and energy between
  the land surface and the atmosphere. Given the strong interactions between the hydrosphere,
  the biosphere, and the cryosphere, understanding the drivers of greening in this
  highly complex region with significant land cover heterogeneity is essential to
  assess the changes in the regional water budget. Here, we perform a holistic multivariate
  remote sensing analysis to simultaneously examine the primary components of the
  terrestrial water cycle from 2003 to 2020 and decipher the principal drivers of
  greening in High-Mountain Asia. We identified three drivers of greening: (1) precipitation
  drives greening in mid and low elevation areas covered by evergreen and mixed forests
  (e.g., Irrawaddy basin), (2) decreases in snow enhance greening in most of the hydrologic
  basins, and (3) irrigation induces greening in irrigated lands (Gangesâ€“Brahmaputra
  and Indus).'
