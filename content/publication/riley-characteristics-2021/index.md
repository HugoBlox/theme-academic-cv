abstract: The mountains of High Mountain Asia serve as an important source of water
  for roughly one billion people living downstream. This research uses 15 years of
  dynamically downscaled precipitation produced by the Weather Research and Forecasting
  (WRF) model to delineate contrasts in precipitation characteristics and events between
  regions dominated by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) versus westerly disturbances
  during the cool season (December to March). Cluster analysis reveals a more complex
  spatial pattern than indicated by some previous studies and illustrates the increasing
  importance of westerly disturbances at higher elevations. Although prior research
  suggests that a small number of westerly disturbances dominate precipitation in
  the western Himalaya and Karakoram, the WRF-downscaled precipitation is less dominated
  by infrequent large events. Integrated vapor transport (IVT) and precipitation are
  tightly coupled in both regions during the cool season, with precipitation maximizing
  for IVT from the south-southwest over the Karakoram and southeast-southwest over
  the western Himalaya. During the ISM, Karakoram precipitation is not strongly related
  to IVT direction, whereas over the western Himalaya, primary and secondary precipitation
  maxima occur for flow from the west-southwest and northwest, respectively. These
  differences in the drivers and timing of precipitation have implications for hydrology,
  glacier mass balance, snow accumulation, and their sensitivity to climate variability
  and change.
