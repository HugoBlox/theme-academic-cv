abstract: Â© 2017 The Author(s) In the field of regenerative medicine, tremendous numbers
  of cells are necessary for tissue/organ regeneration. Today automatic cell-culturing
  system has been developed. The next step is constructing a non-invasive method to
  monitor the conditions of cells automatically. As an image analysis method, convolutional
  neural network (CNN), one of the deep learning method, is approaching human recognition
  level. We constructed and applied the CNN algorithm for automatic cellular differentiation
  recognition of myogenic C2C12 cell line. Phase-contrast images of cultured C2C12
  are prepared as input dataset. In differentiation process from myoblasts to myotubes,
  cellular morphology changes from round shape to elongated tubular shape due to fusion
  of the cells. CNN abstract the features of the shape of the cells and classify the
  cells depending on the culturing days from when differentiation is induced. Changes
  in cellular shape depending on the number of days of culture (Day 0, Day 3, Day
  6) are classified with 91.3% accuracy. Image analysis with CNN has a potential to
  realize regenerative medicine industry.
