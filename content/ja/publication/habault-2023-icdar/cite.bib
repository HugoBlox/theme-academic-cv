 abstract = {Recently, there has been an increased interest in cross-data research problems, such as predicting air quality using life logging images, predicting congestion using weather and tweets data, and predicting sleep quality using daily exercises and meals. Although several research focusing on multimodal data analytics have been performed, few studies have been conducted on cross-data research (e.g., cross-modal data, cross-domain, cross-platform). The article collection “Intelligent Cross-Data Analysis and Retrieval” aims to encourage research in intelligent cross-data analytics and retrieval and contribute to the creation of a sustainable society. Researchers from diverse domains such as well-being, disaster prevention and mitigation, mobility, climate, tourism and healthcare are welcome to contribute to this Research Topic.},
