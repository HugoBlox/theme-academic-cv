abstract: This paper presents a method for reconstructing 3D image from multi-focus
  microscopic images captured with different focuses. We model the multi-focus imaging
  by a microscopy and produce the 3D image of a target object based on the model.
  The 3D image reconstruction is done by minimizing the difference between the observed
  images and the simulated images generated by the imaging model. Simulation and experimental
  result shows that the proposed method can generate the 3D image of a transparent
  object efficiently and reliably.
