abstract: Computational art analysis has, through its reliance on classification tasks,
  prioritised historical datasets in which the artworks are already well sorted with
  the necessary annotations. Art produced today, on the other hand, is numerous and
  easily accessible, through the internet and social networks that are used by professional
  and amateur artists alike to display their work. Although this art---yet unsorted
  in terms of style and genre---is less suited for supervised analysis, the data sources
  come with novel information that may help frame the visual content in equally novel
  ways. As a first step in this direction, we present contempArt, a multi-modal dataset
  of exclusively contemporary artworks. contempArt is a collection of paintings and
  drawings, a detailed graph network based on social connections on Instagram and
  additional socio-demographic information; all attached to 442 artists at the beginning
  of their career. We evaluate three methods suited for generating unsupervised style
  embeddings of images and correlate them with the remaining data. We find no connections
  between visual style on the one hand and social proximity, gender, and nationality
  on the other.
