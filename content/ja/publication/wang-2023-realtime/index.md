abstract: Estimating the surgery length has the potential to be utilized as skill
  assessment, surgical training, or efficient surgical facility utilization especially
  if it is done in real-time as a remaining surgery duration (RSD). Surgical length
  reflects a certain level of efficiency and mastery of the surgeon in a well-standardized
  surgery such as cataract surgery. In this paper, we design and develop a real-time
  RSD estimation method for cataract surgery that does not require manual labeling
  and is transferable with minimum fine-tuning.
