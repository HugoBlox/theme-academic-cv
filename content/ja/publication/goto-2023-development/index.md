abstract: 'Deep learning is a rapidly-evolving technology with the possibility to
  significantly improve the physics reach of collider experiments. In this study we
  developed a novel vertex finding algorithm for future lepton colliders such as the
  International Linear Collider. We deploy two networks: one consists of simple fully-connected
  layers to look for vertex seeds from track pairs, and the other is a customized
  Recurrent Neural Network with an attention mechanism and an encoderâ€“decoder structure
  to associate tracks to the vertex seeds. The performance of the vertex finder is
  compared with the standard ILC vertex reconstruction algorithm.'
