abstract: Most conventional digital video cameras face a fundamental trade-off between
  spatial resolution, temporal resolution and dynamic range (i.e., brightness resolution)
  because of a limited bandwidth for data transmission. A few recent studies have
  shown that with non-uniform space-time sampling, such as that implemented with pixel-wise
  coded exposure, one can go beyond this trade-off and achieve high efficiency for
  scene capture. However, in these studies, the sampling schemes were pre-defined
  and independent of the target scene content. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
  space-time-brightness sampling method to further improve the efficiency of video
  capture. The proposed method adaptively updates a pixel-wise coded exposure pattern
  using the information analyzed from previously captured frames. We built a prototype
  camera that enables adaptive coding of patterns online to show the feasibility of
  the proposed adaptive coded exposure method. Simulation and experimental results
  show that the adaptive space-time-brightness sampling scheme achieves more accurate
  video reconstruction results and high dynamic range with less computational cost,
  than previous method. To the best of our knowledge, our prototype is the first implementation
  of an adaptive pixel-wise coded exposure camera.
