abstract: Lensless imaging protects visual privacy by capturing heavily blurred images
  that are imperceptible for humans to recognize the subject but contain enough information
  for machines to infer information. Unfortunately, protecting visual privacy comes
  with a reduction in recognition accuracy and vice versa. We propose a learnable
  lensless imaging framework that protects visual privacy while maintaining recognition
  accuracy. To make captured images imperceptible to humans, we designed several loss
  functions based on total variation, invertibility, and the restricted isometry property.
  We studied the effect of privacy protection with blurriness on the identification
  of personal identity via a quantitative method based on a subjective evaluation.
  Moreover, we validate our simulation by implementing a hardware realization of lensless
  imaging with photo-lithographically printed masks.
