abstract: 'Topic modeling is a key component to computational legal science. Network
  analysis is also very important to further understand the structure of references
  in legal documents. In this paper, we improve topic modeling for legal case documents
  by using homophily networks derived from two families of references: prior cases
  and statute laws. We perform a detailed analysis on a rich legal case dataset in
  order to create these networks. The use of the reference-induced homophily topic
  modeling improves on prior methods.'
