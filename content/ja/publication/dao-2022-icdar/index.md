abstract: We have witnessed the rise of cross-data against multimodal data problems
  recently. The cross-modal retrieval system uses a textual query to look for images;
  the air quality index can be predicted using lifelogging images; the congestion
  can be predicted using weather and tweets data; daily exercises and meals can help
  to predict the sleeping quality are some examples of this research direction. Although
  vast investigations focusing on multimodal data analytics have been developed, few
  cross-data (e.g., cross-modal data, cross-domain, cross-platform) research has been
  carried on. In order to promote intelligent cross-data analytics and retrieval research
  and to bring a smart, sustainable society to human beings, the specific article
  collection on \"Intelligent Cross-Data Analysis and Retrieval\" is introduced. This
  Research Topic welcomes those who come from diverse research domains and disciplines
  such as well-being, disaster prevention and mitigation, mobility, climate change,
  tourism, healthcare, and food computing.
