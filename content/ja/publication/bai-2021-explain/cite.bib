 abstract = {Have you ever looked at a painting and wondered what is the story behind it? This work presents a framework to bring art closer to people by generating comprehensive descriptions of fine-art paintings. Generating informative descriptions for artworks, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires to 1) describe multiple aspects of the image such as its style, content, or composition, and 2) provide background and contextual knowledge about the artist, their influences, or the historical period. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-topic and knowledgeable art description framework, which modules the generated sentences according to three artistic topics and, additionally, enhances each description with external knowledge. The framework is validated through an exhaustive analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, as well as a comparative human evaluation, demonstrating outstanding results in terms of both topic diversity and information veracity.},
