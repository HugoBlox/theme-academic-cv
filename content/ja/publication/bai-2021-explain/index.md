abstract: Have you ever looked at a painting and wondered what is the story behind
  it? This work presents a framework to bring art closer to people by generating comprehensive
  descriptions of fine-art paintings. Generating informative descriptions for artworks,
  however, is extremely challenging, as it requires to 1) describe multiple aspects
  of the image such as its style, content, or composition, and 2) provide background
  and contextual knowledge about the artist, their influences, or the historical period.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-topic and knowledgeable art description
  framework, which modules the generated sentences according to three artistic topics
  and, additionally, enhances each description with external knowledge. The framework
  is validated through an exhaustive analysis, both quantitative and qualitative,
  as well as a comparative human evaluation, demonstrating outstanding results in
  terms of both topic diversity and information veracity.
