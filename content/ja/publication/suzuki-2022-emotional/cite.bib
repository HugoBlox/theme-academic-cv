 abstract = {We propose a method for personalized emotional intensity estimation based on a writer’s personality test for Japanese SNS posts. Existing emotion analysis models are difficult to accurately estimate the writer’s subjective emotions behind the text. We personalize the emotion analysis using not only the text but also the writer’s personality information. Experimental results show that personality information improves the performance of emotional intensity estimation. Furthermore, a hybrid model combining the existing personalized method with ours achieved state-of-the-art performance.},
