abstract: We propose a method for personalized emotional intensity estimation based
  on a writer’s personality test for Japanese SNS posts. Existing emotion analysis
  models are difficult to accurately estimate the writer’s subjective emotions behind
  the text. We personalize the emotion analysis using not only the text but also the
  writer’s personality information. Experimental results show that personality information
  improves the performance of emotional intensity estimation. Furthermore, a hybrid
  model combining the existing personalized method with ours achieved state-of-the-art
  performance.
