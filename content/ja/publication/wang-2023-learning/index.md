abstract: Interpreting and explaining the behavior of deep neural networks is critical
  for many tasks. Explainable AI provides a way to address this challenge, mostly
  by providing per-pixel relevance to the decision. Yet, interpreting such explanations
  may require expert knowledge. Some recent attempts toward interpretability adopt
  a concept-based framework, giving a higher-level relationship between some concepts
  and model decisions. This paper proposes Bottleneck Concept Learner (BotCL), which
  represents an image solely by the presence/absence of concepts learned through training
  over the target task without explicit supervision over the concepts. It uses self-supervision
  and tailored regularizers so that learned concepts can be human-understandable.
  Using some image classification tasks as our testbed, we demonstrate BotCL's potential
  to rebuild neural networks for better interpretability.
