abstract: "Explainable artificial intelligence has been gaining attention in the past
  few years. However, most existing methods are based on gradients or intermediate
  features, which are not directly involved in the decision-making process of the
  classifier. In this paper, we propose a slot attention-based classifier called SCOUTER
  for transparent yet accurate classification. Two major differences from other attention-based
  methods include: (a) SCOUTER's explanation is involved in the final confidence for
  each category, offering more intuitive interpretation, and (b) all the categories
  have their corresponding positive or negative explanation, which tells \\\"why the
  image is of a certain category\\\" or \\\"why the image is not of a certain category.\\\
  \" We design a new loss tailored for SCOUTER that controls the model's behavior
  to switch between positive and negative explanations, as well as the size of explanatory
  regions. Experimental results show that SCOUTER can give better visual explanations
  in terms of various metrics while keeping good accuracy on small and medium-sized
  datasets."
