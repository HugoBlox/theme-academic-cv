abstract: We propose an efficient pipeline from input to output for a tensor light-field
  display. Conventionally, a dense light field (i.e., tens of images taken with narrow
  viewpoint intervals) is required as an input in such displays. However, obtaining
  dense light fields is a challenging task for real scenes. To make the acquisition
  process more efficient, we adopted a coded-aperture camera as an input device, which
  is suitable for acquiring dense light fields in a compressive manner. Moreover,
  we modeled the entire process from acquisition to display using a convolutional
  neural network. As a result of training the network on a massive light field data,
  we can reproduce the whole light field on the display from only a few images taken
  with the camera. Both simulative and real experiments were conducted to show the
  effectiveness of our method.
