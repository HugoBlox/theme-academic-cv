abstract: Public meeting articles are the key to understanding the history of public
  opinion and public sphere in Australia. Information extraction from public meeting
  articles can obtain new insights into Australian history. In this paper, we create
  an information extraction dataset in the public meeting domain. We manually annotate
  the date and time, place, purpose, people who requested the meeting, people who
  convened the meeting, and people who were convened of 1258 public meeting articles.
  We further present an information extraction system, which formulates information
  extraction from public meeting articles as a machine reading comprehension task.
  Experiments indicate that our system can achieve an F1 score of 74.98% for information
  extraction from public meeting articles.
