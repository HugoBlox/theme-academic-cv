abstract: A light field can carry rich visual information of a real 3-D scene, leading
  to many attractive applications. However, the acquisition of a light field is challenging
  due to the large amount of data. In our previous work, we proposed an efficient
  method for this task using a coded-aperture camera with a convolutional neural network
  (CNN) which can computationally reconstruct a light field from several images acquired
  with different aperture patterns. In this work, we report two follow-up contributions
  to the previous work. First, we integrated a color filter array, which is common
  in RGB cameras, and the related color processing into the algorithm pipeline. This
  integration led to better reconstruction quality for color light fields. We then
  analyzed how the reconstruction quality obtained with our method was affected by
  the complexity of light fields. We also showed the possibility of using this analysis
  to predict the reconstruction quality from the acquired images.
