abstract: © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). We introduce BUDA.ART, a system
  designed to assist researchers in Art History, to explore and analyze an archive
  of pictures of Buddha statues. The system combines different CBIR and classical
  retrieval techniques to assemble 2D pictures, 3D statue scans and meta-data, that
  is focused on the Buddha facial characteristics. We build the system from an archive
  of 50,000 Buddhism pictures, identify unique Buddha statues, extract contextual
  information, and provide specific facial embedding to first index the archive. The
  system allows for mobile, on-site search, and to explore similarities of statues
  in the archive. In addition, we provide search visualization and 3D analysis of
  the statues.
