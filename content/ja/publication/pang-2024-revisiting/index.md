abstract: 'Contrastive image representation learning through instance discrimination
  has shown impressive transfer performance. Recent strategies have focused on pushing
  the limit of their transfer performance for dense prediction tasks, particularly
  when conducting pre-training on scene images with complex structures. Initial approaches
  employ pixel-level contrastive pre-training to optimize dense spatial features,
  while subsequent methods utilize region-mining algorithms to capture holistic regional
  semantics and address the issue of semantically inconsistent scene image crops.
  In this paper, we revisit pixel-level contrastive pre-training on scene images.
  Contrary to the assumption that pixel-level learning falls short in achieving these
  objectives, we demonstrate its under-explored potentials: (1) it can effectively
  learn holistic regional semantics more simply compared to region-level methods,
  and (2) it intrinsically provides tools to mitigate the impact of semantically inconsistent
  views involved with scene-level training images. We propose PixCon, a pixel-level
  contrastive learning framework, and explore two variants with different positive
  matching strategies to investigate the potential of pixel-level learning. Additionally,
  when PixCon incorporates a novel semantic reweighting approach tailored for scene
  image pre-training, it outperforms or matches the performance of previous region-level
  methods in object detection and semantic segmentation tasks across multiple benchmarks.'
