abstract: Several recent studies in compressive video sensing have realized scene
  capture beyond the fundamental trade-off limit between spatial resolution and temporal
  resolution using random space-time sampling. However, most of these studies showed
  results for higher frame rate video that were produced by simulation experiments
  or using an optically simulated random sampling camera, because there are currently
  no commercially available image sensors with random exposure or sampling capabilities.
  We fabricated a prototype complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor
  with quasi pixel-wise exposure timing that can realize nonuniform space-time sampling.
  The prototype sensor can reset exposures independently by columns and fix these
  amount of exposure by rows for each 8Ã—8 pixel block. This CMOS sensor is not fully
  controllable via the pixels, and has line-dependent controls, but it offers flexibility
  when compared with regular CMOS or charge-coupled device sensors with global or
  rolling shutters. We propose a method to realize pseudo-random sampling for high-speed
  video acquisition that uses the flexibility of the CMOS sensor. We reconstruct the
  high-speed video sequence from the images produced by pseudo-random sampling using
  an over-complete dictionary. The proposed method also removes the rolling shutter
  effect from the reconstructed video.
