abstract: We annotate 17,000 SNS posts with both the writer’s subjective emotional
  intensity and the reader’s objective one to construct a Japanese emotion analysis
  dataset. In this study, we explore the difference between the emotional intensity
  of the writer and that of the readers with this dataset. We found that the reader
  cannot fully detect the emotions of the writer, especially anger and trust. In addition,
  experimental results in estimating the emotional intensity show that it is more
  difficult to estimate the writer’s subjective labels than the readers’. The large
  gap between the subjective and objective emotions imply the complexity of the mapping
  from a post to the subjective emotion intensities, which also leads to a lower performance
  with machine learning models.
