abstract: © 2018 Optical Society of America. Label-free visualization of nerves and
  nervous plexuses will improve the preservation of neurological functions in nerve-sparing
  robot-assisted surgery. We have developed a coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering
  (CARS) rigid endoscope to distinguish nerves from other tissues during surgery.
  The developed endoscope, which has a tube with a diameter of 12 mm and a length
  of 270 mm, achieved 0.91% image distortion and 8.6% non-uniformity of CARS intensity
  in the whole field of view (650 µm diameter). We demonstrated CARS imaging of a
  rat sciatic nerve and visualization of the fine structure of nerve fibers.
