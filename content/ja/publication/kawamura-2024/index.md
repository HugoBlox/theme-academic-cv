abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is an important task in the
  field of computer vision. To apply automatic DFER in practice, it is necessary to
  accurately recognize ambiguous facial expressions, which often appear in data in
  the wild. In this paper, we propose MIDAS, a data augmentation method for DFER,
  which augments ambiguous facial expression data with soft labels consisting of probabilities
  for multiple emotion classes. In MIDAS, the training data are augmented by convexly
  combining pairs of video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels, which
  can also be regarded as an extension of mixup to soft- labeled video data. This
  simple extension is remarkably effective in DFER with ambiguous facial expression
  data. To evaluate MIDAS, we conducted experiments on the DFEW dataset. The results
  demonstrate that the model trained on the data augmented by MIDAS outperforms the
  existing state-of-the-art method trained on the original dataset.
