abstract: textlessptextgreaterIt is known that single or isolated tumor cells enter
  cancer patients' circulatory systems. These circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are thought
  to be an effective tool for diagnosing cancer malignancy. However, handling CTC
  samples and evaluating CTC sequence analysis results are challenging. Recently,
  the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a type of deep learning model, has
  been increasingly adopted for medical image analyses. However, it is controversial
  whether cell characteristics can be identified at the single-cell level by using
  machine learning methods. This study intends to verify whether an AI system could
  classify the sensitivity of anticancer drugs, based on cell morphology during culture.
  We constructed a CNN based on the VGG16 model that could predict the efficiency
  of antitumor drugs at the single-cell level. The machine learning revealed that
  our model could identify the effects of antitumor drugs with Ìƒ0.80 accuracies. Our
  results show that, in the future, realizing precision medicine to identify effective
  antitumor drugs for individual patients may be possible by extracting CTCs from
  blood and performing classification by using an AI system.textless/ptextgreater
