 abstract = {Fake media has been spreading due to remarkable advances in media processing and machine leaning technologies, causing serious problems in society. We are conducting a research project called Media Clone aimed at developing methods for protecting people from fake but skillfully fabricated replicas of real media called media clones. Such media can be created from fake information about a specific person. Our goal is to develop a trusted communication system that can defend against attacks of media clones. This paper describes some research results of the Media Clone project, in particular, various methods for protecting personal information against generating fake information. We focus on 1) fake information generation in the physical world, 2) anonymization and abstraction in the cyber world, and 3) modeling of media clone attacks.},
