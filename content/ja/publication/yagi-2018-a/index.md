abstract: A light field, which is often understood as a set of dense multi-view images,
  has been utilized in various 2D/3D applications. Efficient light field acquisition
  using a coded aperture camera is the target problem considered in this paper. Specifically,
  the entire light field, which consists of many images, should be reconstructed from
  only a few images that are captured through different aperture patterns. In previous
  work, this problem has often been discussed from the context of compressed sensing
  (CS). In contrast, we formulated this problem from the perspective of principal
  component analysis (PCA) to derive optimal non-negative aperture patterns and a
  straight-forward reconstruction algorithm. Even though it is based on a conventional
  technique, our method has proven to be more accurate and much faster than a state-of-the-art
  CS-based method.
