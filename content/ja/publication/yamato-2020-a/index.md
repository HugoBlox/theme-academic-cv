abstract: A coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) rigid endoscope was developed
  to visualize peripheral nerves without labeling for nerve-sparing endoscopic surgery.
  The developed CARS endoscope had a problem with low imaging speed, i.e. low imaging
  rate. In this study, we demonstrate that noise reduction with deep learning boosts
  the nerve imaging speed with CARS endoscopy. We employ fine-tuning and ensemble
  learning and compare deep learning models with three different architectures. In
  the fine-tuning strategy, deep learning models are pre-trained with CARS microscopy
  nerve images and retrained with CARS endoscopy nerve images to compensate for the
  small dataset of CARS endoscopy images. We propose using the equivalent imaging
  rate (EIR) as a new evaluation metric for quantitatively and directly assessing
  the imaging rate improvement by deep learning models. The highest EIR of the deep
  learning model was 7.0 images/min, which was 5 times higher than that of the raw
  endoscopic image of 1.4 images/min. We believe that the improvement of the nerve
  imaging speed will open up the possibility of reducing postoperative dysfunction
  by intraoperative nerve identification.
