abstract: Video summarization is a technique to create a short skim of the original
  video while preserving the main stories/content. There exists a substantial interest
  in automatizing this process due to the rapid growth of the available material.
  The recent progress has been facilitated by public benchmark datasets, which enable
  easy and fair comparison of methods. Currently the established evaluation protocol
  is to compare the generated summary with respect to a set of reference summaries
  provided by the dataset. In this paper, we will provide in-depth assessment of this
  pipeline using two popular benchmark datasets. Surprisingly, we observe that randomly
  generated summaries achieve comparable or better performance to the state-of-the-art.
  In some cases, the random summaries outperform even the human generated summaries
  in leave-one-out experiments. Moreover, it turns out that the video segmentation,
  which is often considered as a fixed pre-processing method, has the most significant
  impact on the performance measure. Based on our observations, we propose alternative
  approaches for assessing the importance scores as well as an intuitive visualization
  of correlation between the estimated scoring and human annotations.
