abstract: Human evaluation is critical for validating the performance of text-to-image
  generative models, as this highly cognitive process requires deep comprehension
  of text and images. However, our survey of 37 recent papers reveals that many works
  rely solely on automatic measures (eg, FID) or perform poorly described human evaluations
  that are not reliable or repeatable. This paper proposes a standardized and well-defined
  human evaluation protocol to facilitate verifiable and reproducible human evaluation
  in future works. In our pilot data collection, we experimentally show that the current
  automatic measures are incompatible with human perception in evaluating the performance
  of the text-to-image generation results. Furthermore, we provide insights for designing
  human evaluation experiments reliably and conclusively. Finally, we make several
  resources publicly available to the community to facilitate easy and fast implementations.
