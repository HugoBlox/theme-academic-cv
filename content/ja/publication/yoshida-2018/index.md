abstract: Compressive video sensing is the process of encoding multiple sub-frames
  into a single frame with controlled sensor exposures and reconstructing the sub-frames
  from the single compressed frame. It is known that spatially and temporally random
  exposures provide the most balanced compression in terms of signal recovery. However,
  sensors that achieve a fully random exposure on each pixel cannot be easily realized
  in practice because the circuit of the sensor becomes complicated and incompatible
  with the sensitivity and resolution. Therefore, it is necessary to design an exposure
  pattern by considering the constraints enforced by hardware. In this paper, we propose
  a method of jointly optimizing the exposure patterns of compressive sensing and
  the reconstruction framework under hardware constraints. By conducting a simulation
  and actual experiments, we demonstrated that the proposed framework can reconstruct
  multiple sub-frame images with higher quality.
