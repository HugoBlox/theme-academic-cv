 abstract = {We introduce the RUSE metric for the WMT18 metrics shared task. Sentence embeddings can capture global information that cannot be captured by local features based on character or word N-grams. Although training sentence embeddings using small-scale translation datasets with manual evaluation is difficult, sentence embeddings trained from large-scale data in other tasks can improve the automatic evaluation of machine translation. We use a multi-layer perceptron regressor based on three types of sentence embeddings. The experimental results of the WMT16 and WMT17 datasets show that the RUSE metric achieves a state-of-the-art performance in both segment- and system-level metrics tasks with embedding features only.},
