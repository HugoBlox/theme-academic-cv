abstract: Â© 2017 MVA Organization All Rights Reserved. This paper presents an incremental
  structural modeling approach that improves the precision and stability of existing
  batch based methods for sparse and noisy point clouds from visual SLAM. The main
  idea is to use the generating process of point clouds on SLAM effectively. First,
  a batch based method is applied to point clouds that are incrementally generated
  from SLAM. Then, the temporal history of reconstructed geometric primitives is statistically
  merged to suppress incorrect reconstruction. The evaluation shows that both precision
  and stability are improved compared to a batch based method and the proposed method
  is suitable for real-time structural modeling.
