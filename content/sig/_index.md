**We're glad you asked! :grin:**

SIGs offer a wealth of conferences, publications and activities focused on specific computing sub-disciplines. They enable members to share expertise, discovery and best practices. - ACM

{{< details summary="**What happened to them? :open_mouth: Can I still join one? :monocle_face:**" >}}
A few years ago, some of the SIGs separated from ACM and became their own RSOs at UCF. 

As of right now, ACM & ACM-W don't have any SIGs, but we are currently trying to start them up again!
