## From Belluno to the parking spot
Here are Google Map's directions for getting to the start of the trek; if all goes well, it takes about an hour of driving. Not many cars will be able to park up there, so it is strongly advised to share vehicles!

## Trekking map
Worried you'll wander forever in the woods above Gosaldo? Worry you not, because here's our awesome trekking map, courtesy of [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/tour/98511283)! You can even send this to your phone, thanks to the magic of the internet.

You'll need to walk for about 5km (round trip). There are two possible ways:

- a simple, shorter, steeper path (marked as forward trip in the map below)
- a longer walk on a normal mountain road (return trip in the map below)

We'll mostly move as a group although of course anybody can decide on his/her own what to do. Depending on the group's fitness and on the amount of snow, reaching the Bivouac usually takes 1 to 1.5 hours.
