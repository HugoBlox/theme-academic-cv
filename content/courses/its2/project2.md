## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to:

1. Study and understand architectures for deploying vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. 
2. Understand the impact of traffic parameters and penetration rate of this technologies and their impact on traffic. 
3. Determine side effects of speed regulation technologies in traffic systems
4. Determine some key performance indicators to measure the effects of introducing connected technologies in intelligent transportation systems.
