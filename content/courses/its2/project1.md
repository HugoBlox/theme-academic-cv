## Idea of vehicle platooning 

The main objective of this project is to design a controller for a platoon of vehicles in order to optimize the traffic flow and reduce the fuel consumption. A platoon of vehicles can be seen as follows.

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to:

1. Study and understand the fundamental problem of string stability. 
2. Obtain and create a dynamic model for vehicle platoons and its associate parameters with traffic theory. 
3. Create and design a control strategy for the headway space and analyze its behavior. 
4. Compare and analyze the behavior of parameter setups for variations of the proposed control strategy
