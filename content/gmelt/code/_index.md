# Climate Tools

## Downscaling
### En-GARD
The Ensemble Generalized Analog Regression Downscaling tool [En-GARD](https://github.com/ncar/gard).  En-GARD is a statistical downscaling tool that enables the use of atmospheric circulation information when downscaling climate data. 

### ICAR
The Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research model [ICAR](https://github.com/ncar/icar).  ICAR is a quasi-dynamical downscaling model that simulates regional changes in climate directly from physical principles at a fraction of the computational cost of a full dynamical downscaling model.
