Links to code and tools developed by the High Mountain Asia Team for
assessing and projecting change in the water, ice, snow, hazards,
and related phenomena in HMA.

## Downscaling
### En-GARD
The Ensemble Generalized Analog Regression Downscaling tool [En-GARD](https://github.com/ncar/gard).  En-GARD is a statistical downscaling tool that enables the use of atmospheric circulation information when downscaling climate data. 

### ICAR
The Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research model [ICAR](https://github.com/ncar/icar).  ICAR is a quasi-dynamical downscaling model that simulates regional changes in climate directly from physical principles at a fraction of the computational cost of a full dynamical downscaling model. 

## Glacier Evolution
### PyGEM
The Python Glacier Evolution Model ([PyGEM](https://github.com/drounce/PyGEM)) is an open-source glacier evolution model coded in Python that models the transient evolution of glaciers.

## Glacier Velocity
### itslive
[itslive](https://e-marshall.github.io/itslive/intro.html) is a tutorial that demonstrates how to access and work with multi-dimensional remote sensing data using the python package and open source project xarray. This example will use a glacier surface velocity dataset called ITS_LIVE.

### itslivetools
[itslivetools](https://github.com/e-marshall/itslivetools) is a Python package containing utility functions for accessing and working with ITS_LIVE ice velocity data stored in AWS S3 buckets.

## Debris Cover
### debris_global
[debris_global](https://github.com/drounce/debris_global) is code to calculate the debris thickness of debris-covered glaciers globally using remote sensing data.

## Energy Balance
### sebm
[sebm](https://github.com/alexandragiese/sebm) is a glacier surface energy and mass balance model.

## Hazards
### SALaD
The Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection ([SALaD](https://github.com/nasa/SALaD)) is a landslide mapping system which utilizes Object-based Image Analysis and Random Forest to map landslides from optical imagery and a DEM

## Models
### WRFchem_HMA
[WRFchem_HMA](https://github.com/cenlinhe/WRFchem_HMA/tree/brown_carbon) is WRFchem code development for HMA by including light-absorbing aerosol deposition to CLM/SNICAR snow. WRF version: 3.9.1

### GEOSldas
[GEOSldas](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSldas/tree/feature/rreichle/MODIS_snow_cover_fraction_assimilation) implements the Goddard Earth Observing System Land Data Assimilation Fixture with snow data assimilation

## Remote Sensing
### sentinel1_rtc
[sentinel1_rtc](https://e-marshall.github.io/sentinel1_rtc/intro.html) is a tutorial of Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrates various ways to access, process and work with Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) imagery using the python package and open source project xarray as well as a number of other open source software packages.
