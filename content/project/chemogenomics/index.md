This is a major research line in the Trypanosomatics Lab, which gives rise to a wide variety of projects: 

<ul>
  <li><a href="{{< ref "/project/TDR-targets" >}}">TDR Targets</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{< ref "/project/Yeast-repo" >}}">Yeast-to-Tryp Drug Repurposing</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{< ref "/project/HTS" >}}">High-throughput screening of trypanocidal agents</a></li>
</ul>

All these projects have in common the ultimate goal of finding new
treatments (drugs) for infectious diseases. 

Depending on the approach (computational vs hybrid vs experimental), we may
target a large number of human pathogens (as in [TDR Targets]({{< ref
"/project/TDR-Targets" >}})) or may concentrate only on Chagas Disease
(American Trypanosomiasis, caused by _Trypanosoma cruzi_) or on Sleeping
Sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis, HAT, caused by _Trypanosoma
brucei_). 

Please check the pages for these subprojects for more information.
