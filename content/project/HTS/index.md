This is an interdisciplinary approach to drug discovery that takes advantage of the large amounts of bioactive compounds data gathered for other projects to create drug repurposing proposals/hypotheses. We test these by performing phenotypic or biochemical medium/high-trhoughput screenings to answer different questions regarding drug-target or drug-pathogen interactions.
