title: Survey on preprocessing techniques for Heterogeneous Face recognition with VGG-Face
summary: Matching faces from images of different spectres is stillnowadays a challenging task. In this seminar we present a survey on how well preprocessing techniques perform in Near Infrared (NIR) and visible- light (VIS) face matching.The following preprocessing techniques are going to be de-scripted and evaluated using the pretrained model VGG-Face.Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Difference of Gaussian(DoG), Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), Histogram Equal-ization (HE), Adaptive Single Scale Retinex (ASSR), Ho-momorphic Filtering (HOMO), Isotropic smoothing (IS),Single Scale Self Quotient Image (SSQ), Single Scale We-berfaces Normalization (WEB). Experimentation was per- formed using CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0 Face Data base. Resultsindicate that Histogram Equalization was the best prepro-cessing technique of the nine in various aspects.
