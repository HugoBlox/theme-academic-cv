This summarizes my work at my first ever internship at **Julia Computing** during the winter breaks of 2016 (Nov-2016 to Jan-2017). I wrote julia scripts to load big datasets efficiently and perform unsupervised learning tasks such as *Nearest-Neighbour* clusterring and supervised learning tasks such as *Generalized linear models* for predicting the costs and journey time given relevant variables and location. To create some cool visualizations and of valuable insight I used google maps api!
