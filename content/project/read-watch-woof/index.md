I have a newsletter: **Read, Watch, Woof**! RWW goes out Fridays on TNP off-weeks. It consists, as you may have gathered from the title, a little bit of personal-ish writing by me (also featured here), an interesting and entertaining video to watch, and a picture of one (or more) of our dogs. Enjoy! (And don't worry, I won't give away your email address or spam you. Promise.)
