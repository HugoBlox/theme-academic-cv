title: Data Acquisition System
summary: Data Aquisition System based on Arduino Mega 2560 will be developed. The system has 12 channels, half of them of the range [0,5] V and the rest of the range of [-15,+15] V. The resolution, in most of the channels, is 16 bits, whereas in some channels, only 4 of 12, is 10 bits. The system will save the data in an SD card and send it, via GPRS, to a website developed to visualize the data in real time. The system can be configured to choose which channels will be on and off. It has a real time clock to keep track of the time and date when the measure was made, an LCD display to show which task the system is performing and an SMU to that will allow the system to measure currents. The system is completely portable and can function on his own in an autonomous way.
