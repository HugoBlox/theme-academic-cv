The structure is designed in an intuitive manner which may be extended and customised to meet one's own cipher apart from some pre loaded ciphers such as AES-128. One can also extend the package by including files (or function) of thier own versions of attacks apart from what is provided such as Correlation Power Analysis (CPA), Template Attacks (TA)"
