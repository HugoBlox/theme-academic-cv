For those of us who went to Brigham Young University, we've all seen the Student Housing Guide (link) that shows a table of information for approved campus housing.  There's a lot of great data there, but unfortunately it's presented in a terrible medium.  The booklet is 99 pages of ads for the 2 pages of useful information.  The data is squashed into a few tables of data that is hard to read, difficult to sort through, and impossible to visualize on a map.  I decided a better medium for the housing search would be a query-able app, complete with maps and sorting functionalities.  The app is available on the Google Play store as "BYU Housing Finder."

Note: the name of the app has changed to "Find BYU Housing."  I offered this completed application to Brigham Young University press, who immediately met with me and said that I could be sued over copyright issues (they claimed the data in the Housing Guide was copyrighted.  I said that the apartment info I gathered was from online apartments and thus could not be copyrighted by them).  I was a little miffed, but since I like being a student here and don't want any disciplinary issues I have not advertised the application and changed the name, at their request.  It turns out they get most of their money from the ads in the Housing Guide and if I made this app it would severly hurt their journalism program. So, that's my story of trying to help out BYU.
