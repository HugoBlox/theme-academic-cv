The ONR-funded project FLEAT aims at studying interactions of mean-flow and topography in the vicinity of Palau. We try to answer questions like *how are energy and momentum of mean and meso-scale flow affected by interactions with bathymetry?*

The vicinity of Palau in the tropical North Pacific provides an ideal natural laboratory - steep topography and strong currents make up for exciting experiment sites. In June 2016 we deployed moorings and carried out shipboard measurements with various instruments to study the generation of lee waves and lee vortices as the flow interacted with the northern end of Palau.
