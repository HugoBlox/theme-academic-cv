title: Compact Particle Accelerators for Cultural Heritage Applications
summary: Particles accelerators, such as Synchrotron light sources and Ion Beam Accelerators, are powerful tools for discovery, enabling across many scientific fields including cultural heritage. However often cultural heritage objects and artefacts cannot be taken outside of their country of origin due to legal restrictions or burdensome bureaucracy. Similarly, museum curators are often hesitant to risk moving valuable artworks and the insurance and security costs of transporting artworks can be prohibitively expensive. These factors can restrict access to accelerator-based facilities, keeping heritage science secrets undiscovered. A portable 2 MeV proton accelerator would allow us to bring to the accelerator to countries and regions that donâ€™t have local access to accelerator facilities for researchers to conduct non-destructive, non-invasive measurements.
