Information extraction is concerned with extracting information about entities, phrases and relations between them from text to populate knowledge bases, such as extracting "employee-at" relations.
Within this context, we have worked on automatic knowledge base completion, knowledge base cleansing and detecting scientific keyphrases in text.
