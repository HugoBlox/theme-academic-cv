A programmable storage system exposes  internal subsystem abstractions as “interfaces” to enable the creation  of higher-level services via composition. Malacology is a programmable  storage system that enables the programmability of internal abstractions in Ceph. Using Malacology, we built the Mantle and ZLog services.
