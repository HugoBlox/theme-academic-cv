As storage devices get faster, data  management tasks rob the host of CPU cycles and DDR bandwidth. In this  project, we examine a new interface to storage devices that can leverage existing and new CPU and DRAM resources to take over data management tasks like availability, recovery, and migrations *that span many storage devices*. This new interface  provides a roadmap for device- to-device interactions and more powerful  storage devices capable of providing in-store compute services that can  dramatically improve performance. We call such storage devices  “eusocial” because we are inspired by eusocial insects like ants,  termites, and bees, which as individuals are primitive but collectively  accomplish amazing things.
