abstract: The frequency properties of visual objects and object names in daily life are fundamentally different, and they do not set up a rich co-occurrence structure. However, both modalities select for early-learned object names. The rarity of co-occurrences of early-learned object-name pairs in the mealtime context suggests that infants may be learning from minimal co-occurrence data as long as half of the pair (the object or its name) is highly frequent.
