            This course serves as an introduction to operating systems concepts.
            Students learn different mechanisms by which an operating system
            manages and distributes hardware and computing resources. Students
            explore topics related to memory management, file-system
            organization, and security and privacy from a systems
            perspective. Students gain hands-on experience by modifying and
            adding features to a small educational Unix-like operating system.

            Quarters taught: Spring 2021, Fall 2021, Winter 2022, Spring 2022,
            Winter 2023, Spring 2023.

            This course serves as an introduction to computer instruction set
            architecture and implementation. Students learn historical
            perspectives, performance evaluation, computer organization,
            single-cycle, multi-cycle, and pipelined data paths and control.
            Students learn to program using RISC-V assembly and design and
            implement a miniscule instruction set processor.

            Quarters taught: Fall 2021, Winter 2022, Fall 2022.

            This is an upper-level class aimed at introducing students to the
            basic concepts of network security, with an emphasis on practical
            and research skills. Students approach the network stack layer by
            layer, researching vulnerabilities and implementing defenses. The
            topics covered in this class include authentication, key
            distribution, message authentication, access control, protocol
            security, virtual private networks, and onion routing.

            Quarters taught: Spring 2022.

          description: |2-
            This course serves as an introduction to data structures and
            algorithms analysis. Students learn to analyze algorithms using
            exact and big $\texttt{O}$ runtime. By completing several major
            programming labs, students learn to write and debug efficient code
            using a variety of data structures and algorithmic approaches.

            Quarters taught: Winter 2021.

        - title: 'CSSE120: Introduction to Software Development'

          description: |2-
            This course serves as an introduction to procedural and
            object-oriented programming using the Python programming language,
            with an emphasis on problem solving. Problems include visualizing
            scientific or commercial data, interfacing with external hardware
            such as robots, or solving numeric problems from a variety of
            engineering disciplines.

            Quarters taught: Fall 2020.
        
        - title: 'ECE541: Computer System Analysis'
          date_start: '2018-08-01'
          organization: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
          organization_url: https://uiuc.edu

          description: |-2
            This class is an graduate-level computer system analysis class where
            students develop and solve analytical models of computer systems.
            Students learn different theoretical modeling tools to model
            existing systems and analyze their availability and performance. 
            From models with impractical or no-known analytic solutions,
            students develop computer simulation models by learning the basics
            of event-driven simulation and random number generation.

            Semester taught: Fall 2018 (while a graduate student at UIUC).
