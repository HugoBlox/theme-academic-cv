The Environmental Disturbance Index goup is creating an Environmental Disturbance
index (EnDI) that accounts for shifting climate, cryosphere, hydrology, aerosols,
extreme events, and hazards across High Mountain Asia at high resolution. Most previous
studies often focus on a subset of systems (e.g., cryosphere response to climate).
Studies that integrate changes across systems tend to either focus on a small target
region (e.g., a single subbasin) or more regionally at coarse resolution. Here, we are
leveraging the new, high-resolution products within GMELT to look at how changes across
the physical environment superimpose at subbasin scales. We assess how the EnDI and its
sub-components vary across different climatic and topographic settings and identify
regions with significant uncertainties. For a subset of regions where EnDI is particularly
high, we will investigate dynamical interactions between components (e.g., aerosol impacts
snow impacts permafrost impacts landslides).
