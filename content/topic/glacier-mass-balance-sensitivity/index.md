The glacier mass balance sensitivity subgroup is seeking to evaluate the performance of
energy balance and temperature-index models on predicting historical and present-day mass
change to determine if temperature-index models overpredict mass loss as has been implied
by studies in the past. The subgroup will leverage existing modeling efforts as well as
geodetic mass balance datasets to develop a standardized method for calibrating the models
using historical mass balance data and then assessing performance by comparing to
present-day mass change estimates (i.e., a completely independent dataset). If possible,
we will use climate products developed from the HiMAT team to force the model runs. This
is a collaborative effort that still requires a bit of development. The next subgroup
meeting will be in Fall (September or October) 2022, where we will focus on identifying
the locations of interest and the calibration framework that we can set to be consistent
amongst modelers.  We then intend to start testing the calibration framework over the
Fall semester to identify any challenges prior to the development of the modeling
framework and potential analyses that will be used to conduct the study.
