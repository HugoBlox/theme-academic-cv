Recent compilations of historical glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) across HMA document
the occurrence of over fifty events with dates after 1990. For the majority of these
events, however, little is currently known about meteorological forcing or environmental
conditions leading up to the event. Using a variety of HMA team data sets and model
outputs this effort seeks to characterize meteorological and environmental conditions in
the run-up to each even to determine if robust threshold or triggering states can be
identified. Are there robust rainfall intensity-duration thresholds, temperature
thresholds, glacier degradation patterns, permafrost degradation, snow melt, etc. that
can robustly separate non-events from observed GLOF events? If threshold states can be
identified, we will then use new downscaled GCM data sets to explore how the exceedance
probability of a particular state will change in the future.
