The overarching question driving the HiMAT-2 Water Budget Subgroup is __“Can we close the
overall water budget in High Mountain Asia?”__ Within that question, we also ask:

- How has each water budget component changed over time?
- What drives total water storage (TWS) variability and changes? 
- How have the extremes in each component changed over time? 
- How are natural vs. anthropogenic factors impacting TWS and its components? 
- What are we missing in our current tools to capture these factors?

These questions build on efforts from the HiMAT-1 Water Budget Subgroup that focused on a
comparison between different modeled estimates of TWS and independent observations of
individual water budget components compared to two GRACE products. A paper by
[Loomis et al. [2019]](/publication/loomis-water-2019/) showed that TWS trends estimated
directly from GRACE L1B data can be explained by trends in glacier mass balance for 72% of
the 1-arc-degree mascons in glaciated areas and by trends in groundwater for 44% of the
mascons in downstream areas. Figure 1 shows the independent glacier mass balance trends
compared to the GRACE L1B trends in glaciated areas and Figure 2 show the trend in
groundwater form in situ observations compared to the GRACE L1B trends in the downstream
areas from (Figures 3 and 4 from Loomis et al. [2019], respectively). Both figures show
that the trends in the independent components agree in sign to the GRACE trends for the
majority of the mascons, even if the magnitudes differ beyond the margin of error.

While this paper made promising steps toward closing the water budget, more work is needed
to identify the dominant drivers of TWS trends and seasonality over the entire domain. The
HiMAT-2 Water Budget Subgroup will be continuing this work with a combination of models,
in-situ observations and GRACE. Table 1 shows the different models represented in the
group along with subgroup members.

Each model team will run over a common domain with common forcing, but at different
spatial resolutions specific to each team. The domain is the river basins within 20-45&deg;&nbsp;N
latitude and 60-110&deg;&nbsp;E longitude. An ensemble average of IMERG, CHIRPS, and ERA5 will be
used for the precipitation forcing and ERA5 for temperature. The common forcings were
chosen after a comparison of the trends and uncertainties across the domain for seven
precipitation products and three temperature products. By using common forcings across the
teams, we hope to better isolate opportunities for model development to support water
budget closure. The Water Budget Subgroup also has direct crossovers with the Downscaling,
Validation & Assimilation, and Projections & Forecasts Subgroups.
