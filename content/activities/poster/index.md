        My PhD project is called LIFTS for **_"LearnIng Featured Transition Systems"_**. It aims at automatically learning transition systems that capture the **behaviour of a whole family of software-based systems**. Reasoning at the family level has been shown to yield important economies of scale and quality improvements for a broad range of systems such as software product lines, adaptive and configurable systems. Yet, to fully benefit from the above advantages, a model of the system familyâ€™s behaviour is necessary. Such a model is often prohibitively expensive to create manually due to the **combinatorial explosion** of system variants (that is, all the configurations corresponding to the different members of the system family). For large long-lived systems with outdated specifications or for systems that continuously adapt, the modeling cost is even higher. Therefore, this thesis proposes to **automate the learning** of such models from existing artifacts. To advance research at a fundamental level, our learning target are **Featured Transition Systems (FTS)**, an abstract formalism that can be used to provide a pivot semantics to a range of state-based modeling languages such as UML state diagrams (adapted to software families). More specifically, the main research questions addressed by this project are:

        1. Can we learn variability-aware models **efficiently**?
        2. Can we learn FTS in a **black-box** fashion? (i.e. with access to execution logs but not to source code);
        3. Can we learn FTS in a **white/grey-box** testing fashion? (i.e. with access to source code);
        4. How do the proposed techniques **scale** in practice?

        This project was summarised in the following poster. It was presented in April 2022, during the second edition of the [Women & Girls in Science Day](https://wgis.unamur.be/) organised by the University of Namur (Belgium).
