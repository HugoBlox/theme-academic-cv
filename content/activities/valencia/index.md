During my master thesis, I had the chance to go in Valencia (Spain) for a three months research internship. From February to April 2019, I worked on an SMT-based concolic testing tool for logic programs, under the supervision of Pr. German Vidal. My thesis was nominated for the [Jean Fichefet award](https://nouvelles.unamur.be/upnews.2019-12-02.9958261385/view). This best master thesis award promotes scientific excellence and a spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship, investing in new fields and new avenues. In 2020, this work was published as a short paper in the 15th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming (FLOPS 2020, Akita, Japan). Due to Covid-19, the conference was held online.
