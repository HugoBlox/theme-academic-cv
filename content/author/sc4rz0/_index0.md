Always driven by the never-ending pursuit of knowledge, and having a solid Electrical Engineering background, I have decided to expand my expertise on Autonomous Systems and Robotics by pursuing a MSc in Denmark's Technical University. This is a stepping stone into fulfilling my aspirations, meeting new people and composing ideas, as to me, the perception of human ingenuity in the people around us, is a purpose and a reason for existence.
