I am really interested in the concepts of Innovation and Entrepreneurship and I would really like to know more about them as they are vital while creating a new startup. Emerging technologies are always something to study on since they provide new technological functionalities and capabilities and can definitely be integrated into products (such as in robotic systems, where the continuous improvement of AI and Machine Learning is in need of emerging technologies).
