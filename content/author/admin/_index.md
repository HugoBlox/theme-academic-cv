Hi, I'm Mikayla. I love all things Disney, data science, and machine learning. 

I'm a recent graduate of Stanford University (2019), where I studied Management Science & Engineering. Currently, I work as a data & analytics intern @ Disney. 

I made this site to share the projects I'm working on and what I've learned in the process. Although I prefer and primarily work in R, I use Python as well and like to go back and forth when convenient.
