Hi, I'm Mikayla.

I'm a recent graduate of Stanford University (2019), where I studied Management Science & Engineering. 

I enjoy constructing datasets using unstructured data and unconventional sources. I made this site to share the projects I'm working on and what I've learned in the process. I am interested in machine learning systems, open source development, and DevOps for data science. 
I work in both R & Python (depending on the task) and like to go back and forth when convenient. I built this site using R blogdown, and the source code can be found on my GitHub.
