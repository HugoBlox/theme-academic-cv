I am a passionate communicator of ideas with experience and education in data visualization, data retrieval and analysis, and marketing. With a Bachelor's in MIS, a Master of Data Science, and experience in the private industry and government, I seek to address the challenges of the future with my skill and drive. I am interested in learning more in machine learning, user experience interfaces, and market related data modeling. As I am finishing my Master's, I am seeking full-time roles for September 2019 in data analytics and visualization in Montreal and Ottawa.
