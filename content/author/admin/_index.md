I am Uddeshya Upadhyay, a fourth-year undergrad student pursuing Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in **Computer science and Engineering** along with a minor in **Physics** at [**Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay**](http://iitb.ac.in/). My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and image analysis. I'm currently working with [**Prof. Suyash P Awate**](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/) on *deep generative models*, *quality enhancement and uncertainty estimation methods for medical image analysis using deep learning*.
I am also working with [**Prof. Biplab Banerjee**](http://bbanerjee.netlify.com/) on *deep learning methods in limited data regime* specifically applied to *remote-sensing and computer vision applications*. In past, I've had wonderful opportunities to work with [**Prof. Arjun jain**](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajain) and [**Prof. Anupam Chattopadhyay**](https://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=ANUPAM).
