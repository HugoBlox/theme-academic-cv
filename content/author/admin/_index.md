I am a second-year PhD student in Statistics at [Northwestern](https://www.statistics.northwestern.edu/). Broadly, I am interested in statistics for social good, particularly the intersection of global health, development, and human rights.

This past year, I have served as a statistical consultant for the [Young Research Group](http://serayoung.org/), focusing on longitudinal study design to measure maternal and child nutrition in diverse socioeconomic contexts.

Previously, I was at Carnegie Mellon, where I worked with Professor Bill Eddy and the [MIDAS](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/research/group/526#quicktabs-lab_group_quicktabs=0) group on synthetic ecosystems for agent-based models of infectious disease.
