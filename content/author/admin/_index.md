CopeNLU is a Natural Language Processing research group with a focus on researching methods for tasks that require a deep understanding of language, as opposed to shallow processing.
We are affiliated with the <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/research/machine-learning">Machine Learning Section</a> at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, as well as <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/research/imagesection/nlp/">NLP at the University of Copenhagen</a>. We are interested in core methodology research on, among others, learning with limited training data; as well as applications thereof to tasks such as fact checking, knowledge base population and question answering.
