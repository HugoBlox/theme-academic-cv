[CSLabs](https://www.cslabs.be/) is a non-profit organisation founded by students from Unamurâ€™s Faculty of Computer Science,  with the primary mission of promoting computer science between and beyond the university walls. CSLabs offers training sessions encompassing both technical (*e.g.*, Git, CSS) and non-technical domains (*e.g.*, effective email communication). These training sessions are conducted by fellow students, creating a peer-driven learning environment.

CSLabs provides students with valuable support in finding student jobs in computer science-related fields. They assist in various aspects, including the job search process, forming teams for substantial projects, and drafting contracts to ensure that students' rights are protected and they receive fair compensation. 

Additionally, CSLabs annually organizes a Hackathon, a thrilling programming contest open to students from all over Belgium. This Hackathon centers around a specific theme, challenging participants to showcase their innovative prowess and problem-solving skills.

I had the privilege of joining CSLabs shortly after its inception, and my involvement deepened as I assumed the role of secretary on the board after a few months. I was in charge of tasks such as:

- Organising board meetings and general assembly
- Writing new procedures (very important for such a young organisation!)
- Being in charge of recruitment procedures
- Organising the (first) annual Hackathon
