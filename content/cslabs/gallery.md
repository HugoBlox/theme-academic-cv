CSLabs is a non-profit organisation founded by students from Unamurâ€™s Faculty of Computer Science, in order to promote computer science externally and provide trainings in different fields by and for students. I joined CSLabs shortly after its creation. After a few months, I joined the board as the secretary. I was in charge of tasks such as:

- Organising board meetings and general assembly
- Writing new procedures (very important for such a young organisation!)
- Being in charge of recruitment procedures
- Organising the (first) annual Hackathon
