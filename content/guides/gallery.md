When I was five years old, my parents send me to a group of [Girl Guides](https://www.guides.be/) , close to our home. I spent all my Sunday mornings in a group of girls about the same age as I. In July, it was the great adventure: the annual camp. One or two weeks lost in the Belgium countryside. I learned to be more open-minded, sociable and autonomous. At 17, it was time for me to give back what I was given. I decided to join a group staff. During six years, I supervised children and youths from different groups:

- Leader of the 8-12 year olds 2013-2015
- Leader of the 12-16 year olds 2015-2016
- Leader for young adults with mental disabilities 2017-2020

In parallel, I obtained my Holiday Centre Trainer’s Certificate in 2014. The next year, I became a federal trainer for new leaders. In 2023, after many years of service, I finally hung up my Girl Guide scarf to begin a new journey.
