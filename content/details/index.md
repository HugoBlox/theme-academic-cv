# Organisational details on how to snowball

## Where and when do we meet?
Wondering how to get to us? Here are some organisational details to help with planning your trip!  
We will meet in front of Belluno's train station the morning of the 4th of January, 2020, at 09:00. From there on, we will organise transportation bty car and separate the participants in groups, in order to minimise the number of cars.

#### How to get to Belluno
Getting to Belluno by car is easy: it is about a 1.5 hour drive from Padova and Venice, 2.5 hours from Trieste, 4 hours from Milan. Belluno is server by the A27 highway. Train lines reach the city from East (Conegliano), North (Cortina) and South (Padova); trains are usually few and far between, so plan your trip in advance.

#### Accomodation
09:00 in the morning is too early for you, or you fear you'll miss the last train? Fret you not! APAZAF will try to find free accomodation for you in the house of one of the participants from Belluno, fellow snowballers are more than welcome! Just let us know in advance when you register and we'll try to reserve a bed for you. If you change your mind, just [contact us](/contact)!

## Getting to the battle site

#### From Belluno to the start of the walk
From Belluno, we'll head to Faustin, which is above Gosaldo (which is above Agordo), where we will start walking.  
Here are Google Map's directions for getting to the start of the trek; if all goes well, it takes about an hour of driving. Not many cars will be able to park up there, so it is strongly advised to share vehicles!
The exact GPS coordinates of the parking area are [46.217733N, 11.928870E](https://goo.gl/maps/ip4GK8xxJjwSsrPr5).

#### Trekking map
Worried you'll wander forever in the woods above Gosaldo? Worry you not, because here's our awesome trekking map, courtesy of [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/tour/98511283)! You can even send this to your phone, thanks to the magic of the internet.

You'll need to walk for about 5km (round trip). There are two possible ways:

- a simple, shorter, steeper path (marked as forward trip in the map below)
- a longer walk on a normal mountain road (return trip in the map below)

We'll mostly move as a group although of course anybody can decide on his/her own what to do. Depending on the group's fitness and on the amount of snow, reaching the Bivouac usually takes around 1.5 hours.

blah blah

#### What happens if it rains?
It does not rain, we have precise agreements with the weatherman. If by some mysterious astral alignement it happens, then we can have a rainball fight.

#### Price
No price, but suggested ticket of 5-10€?

#### Exercise care!
Be careful! This is not a trip to a very touristic hut: getting to the Battle site requires effort and will. It is not an hard trek by any means, but be prepared to be tired, especially if you are not used to this kind of things.

As such, be careful of where you step, listen to your more experienced snow colleagues and trust their judgement.

#### What to do in Belluno
Belluno and the surrounding towns are a small, little-know gem at the foot of the famous Dolomites, well worth a few days off if you can spare some. Feel free to combine your snowballing fever with some trekking, climbing or skiing in one of the various beautiful locations around the city. Keep in mind that you will likely need a car to be able to enjoy all of the attractions that surround Belluno. A good site kept up-to-date with events and information is that of [AdorableBelluno](http://adorable.belluno.it/).
