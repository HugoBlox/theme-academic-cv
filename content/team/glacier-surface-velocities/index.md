HiMAT is both building new velocity data products and evaluating currently available
velocity products across High Mountain Asia. The group is assessing velocity at high
spatial and temporal resolution across the varied glacier hypsometry, terminus types,
debris-covered areas, and climatic and topographic settings. They are also working with
other groups to use these products and results to, for example, validate glacier models
and to understand better the interactions between glacial lake growth and glacier
dynamics.
