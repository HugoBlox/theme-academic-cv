This is the schedule for the Fall 2020 LSD seminar. Because this seminar is completely virtual, we're excited to have been able to recruit speakers from a variety of universities! Even if you are not at UCSC, we may stream the talks over Twitch; feel free to pop join in (stay tuned for links!)

The table will be updated with titles and abstracts at least 1 week before the talk. All talks begin at noon Pacific Time (PT).

Click on any date to scroll to a title and abstract.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact [Lindsey](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/) or [Tyler](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/)

# Oct. 2

Class introduction 

# Oct. 9

**Speaker:**  [Matthías Páll Gissurarson](https://mpg.is/) (_Chalmers University_)

**Title:** Weakening Type Systems for Faster Prototyping 

**Abstract:** Types and type systems are great to provide the compiler with a partial specification of our programs, but it can often be tricky to write code that matches said specification. In this talk, I will demonstrate how we can allow developers to opt-in to a weaker type system "just get it to compile", and what we can do to "fix" the code during compilation so that it matches the specification provided using synthesis and coercions, and hint to the developer what the issue is and how they might fix it.
