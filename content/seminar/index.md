This is the schedule for the Fall 2020 LSD seminar. Because this seminar is completely virtual, we're excited to have been able to recruit speakers from a variety of universities! Even if you are not at UCSC, we may stream the talks over Twitch; feel free to pop join in (stay tuned for links!)

The table will be updated with titles and abstracts at least 1 week before the talk. All talks begin at noon Pacific Time (PT).

Click on any date to scroll to a title and abstract.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact [Lindsey](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/) or [Tyler](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/)

# Oct. 2

Class introduction 

# Oct. 9

**Speaker:**  [Matthías Páll Gissurarson](https://mpg.is/) (_Chalmers University_)

**Title:** Weakening Type Systems for Faster Prototyping 

**Abstract:** Types and type systems are great to provide the compiler with a partial specification of our programs, but it can often be tricky to write code that matches said specification. In this talk, I will demonstrate how we can allow developers to opt-in to a weaker type system "just get it to compile", and what we can do to "fix" the code during compilation so that it matches the specification provided using synthesis and coercions, and hint to the developer what the issue is and how they might fix it.

**Title:** Everything Old is New Again: Binary Security of WebAssembly

**Abstract:** WebAssembly is an increasingly popular, low-level binary format designed
to run code in browsers and on other platforms safely and securely, by
strictly separating code and data, enforcing types, and limiting
indirect control flow. Still, vulnerabilities in memory-unsafe source
languages can translate to vulnerabilities in WebAssembly binaries. We
have analyzed to what extent vulnerabilities are exploitable in
WebAssembly binaries, and how this compares to native code. We find that
many classic vulnerabilities which, due to common mitigations, are no
longer exploitable in native binaries, are completely exposed in
WebAssembly. Moreover, WebAssembly enables unique attacks, such as
overwriting supposedly constant data or manipulating the heap using a
stack overflow. In this talk, we will explain several attack primitives
that allow an attacker (i) to write arbitrary memory, (ii) to overwrite
sensitive data, and (iii) to trigger unexpected behavior by diverting
control flow or manipulating the host environment. This can ultimately
lead to new forms of cross-site scripting in the browser or remote code
execution on Node.js. We will also demonstrate one of our three
end-to-end exploits, which cover three different WebAssembly platforms.
In our quantitative evaluation of real-world WebAssembly binaries, we
also measure how likely our attack primitives are feasible in practice.
Overall, our findings show a perhaps surprising lack of binary security
in WebAssembly. Finally, we will discuss some potential mitigations and
give recommendations on how to harden WebAssembly binaries in the future.
