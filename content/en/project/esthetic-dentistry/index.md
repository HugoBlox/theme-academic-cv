There have been ever-increasing demands for esthetics in the oral cavity after tooth restorations. Especially in the anterior, functional restoration is not enough; restored teeth should have similar color tones and light transmissions to natural teeth because the appearance of restored teeth when exposed to light varies greatly depending on the material used for the crown restoration device and the abutment structure. 

Therefore, by analyzing the optical properties of various dental restoration materials and dental tissues via optical simulation, the behavior of light in natural teeth and dental restorations is visualized and analyzed for esthetic tooth restorations.
