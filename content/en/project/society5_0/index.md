D3 Center, Osaka University is now working on [Society 5.0](https://www.ildi.ids.osaka-u.ac.jp/) using information science and technology. 

> In the world of Society 5.0, innovations in IoT, Big Data, robotics, and AI will be part of everyday life, helping people lead active and high-quality lives, creating a super-smart society. This project encourages collaboration across projects and university organizations, thus promoting faster adoption of research results in real-world society.

Under this big project, we are working two sub-projects:

## Social sensing for Society 5.0

Sensing technologies that aggregate various types of information from publicly and ubiquitously available social probes including social networking services are essential for providing various services in the world of Society 5.0. We are working towards establishing a social sensing technology that can infer emotional states of people for timely services. 

## Future school technology for Society 5.0 

Education everywhere is one of SDGs, and e-learning is one solution toward this. We collectively working on a broad range of technologies related to e-learning.
