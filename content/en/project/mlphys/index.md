title: "MLPhys: Foundation of Machine Learning Physics"
summary: "Throughout its long history, physics has provided the most precise testing ground in the natural sciences, solving problems in various natural hierarchies in collaboration with the mathematical sciences. On the other hand, the field of machine learning is a major research field, a mathematical system that forms the foundation of artificial intelligence and has seen explosive progress in recent years due to advances in computational science. We are launching the transformative research area Machine Learning Physics to integrate these two major fields."

Throughout its long history, physics has provided the most precise testing ground in the natural sciences, solving problems in various natural hierarchies in collaboration with the mathematical sciences. 

On the other hand, the field of machine learning is a major research field, a mathematical system that forms the foundation of artificial intelligence and has seen explosive progress in recent years due to advances in computational science. We are launching the transformative research area "Machine Learning Physics" to integrate these two major fields.
