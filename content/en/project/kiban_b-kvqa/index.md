Visual question answering (VQA) with knowledge is a task that requires knowledge to answer questions on images/video. This additional requirement of knowledge poses an interesting challenge on top of the classic VQA tasks. Specifically, a system needs to explore external knowledge sources to answer the questions correctly, as well as understanding the visual content.

We created [a dedicated dataset for our knowledge VQA task](https://knowit-vqa.github.io) and made it open to the public so that everyone can enjoy our new task. The results are presented at [AAAI 2020](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-20/).

Representation of videos has been a major research topic for various deep learning applications including visual question answering. This is a challenging problem especially for tasks that involves vision and language and some researchers pointed out that deep neural network-based models mainly use natural language text but not the vision. We propose to use textual representation of videos, in which SOTA models for detection/recognition are used for generating text together with some rules. The results are presented at [ECCV 2020](https://eccv2020.eu).

We also work on question answering on art, which requires high-level understanding of paintings themselves as well as associated knowledge on them.
