## Participants' opinion

We interviewed two GBPN fans, whom we shall denote by John Doe and Richard Roe. 

#### How many editions of the GBPN have you attended?
JD: Three, I think. Dunno. RR: 

#### Have you won more or lost more?
JD: Lost more, but honourably. RR: 

#### Were you well equipped?
JD: Yes, I had good teachers. RR: 

#### How did you find the way up? And the way down?
JD: Up, following the group. Down, I just went where my sled carried me. RR: 

#### How would you describe your fighting style?
JD: Haphazardly, or buried in snow to my armpits wearing a white hat. RR: 

#### How was the food?
JD: Much. RR: 

#### How important is strategy? And tactics?
JD: It isn't, since the best plan only survives until contact with the enemy. RR: 

#### What do we do if there is no snow?
JD: Slackline! RR: 

#### Will you be there this year?
JD: Yes. RR: 

#### Have you read the rules?
JD: Yes, uhm. RR: 

#### What makes you fight on when all seems lost?
JD: Thinking of the sugar tea waiting at the end. RR:
