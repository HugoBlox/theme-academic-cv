# Snow status

You can verify the current snow status by checking the values reported by the Malga Losch weather station from [ARPAV](https://www.arpa.veneto.it/bollettini/meteo/h24/img00/Graf_390.htm?sens=LIVNEVE), located close to the battlesite, at the same height and exposition.  
[Here](https://www.arpa.veneto.it/bollettini/meteo60gg/Staz_390.htm) you can find the weather table for the last 60 days. The graph for yesterday is here reported for convenience:

The Scarpa--Gurekian hut is placed nearby the Malga, and has a beautiful webcam pointing N-E towards the Agordo Valley. It is also a very good indicator of the current amount of snow. This is the last image taken (it might not be updated!):

For more webcam shots from other huts, we highly recommend the [RifugInRete site](https://www.rifuginrete.com/webcam). You'll also find some images of the last 24h from several huts there, including the Scarpa--Gurekian.
