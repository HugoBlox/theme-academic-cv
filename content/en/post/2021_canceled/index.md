Dear all,

in the past several years, our most loyal fighters know that we, APAZAF, have gone to great lengths to organise this event even when the conditions were looking poor and snow was only present in our most daring dreams.
Most years, no matter the situation, we managed to cobble something together, be it playing hide-and-seek or just casually hiking with good friends.

There will be an year when the Great Snowball Battle will come back.
There will be more snow, more participants and, most importantly, more risotto than ever.

But it is not this year.

This year, despite the fact that the Battle would take place in a relatively safe environment, we feel it would be irresponsible to organise a gathering of tens of people, some of which also probably staying for the night.
Additionally, the current Italian regulations with regards to the Coronavirus restrictions are shifting very rapidly, and this complicates the already daunting organisational task.

With no guarantee that the Battle can be fought while ensuring the safety and well-being of all participants, it is with immense pain and immeasurable sorrow that we have to announce that the 2020 Great Snowball Battle, which was to be held on the 2nd of January, 2021, is to be considered canceled!, stone dead!, no more!, pushing up the daisies!

IT IS AN EX-BATTLE!

In the meantime, stay safe, be responsible and hold tight for the next Great Snowball Battle, to be held on the 8th of January, 2022!

Snowfully yours, APAZAF

PS: as a consolation, you will find a gallery with the best pictures of the 2020 edition [here](/gallery).

PPS: next year we will make sure to forbid pandemics in the [rulebook](/rules).
