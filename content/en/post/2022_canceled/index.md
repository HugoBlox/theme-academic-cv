Dear all,

once again we are forced by circumstances to cancel the Great Snowball Fight.
It is not a decision we make lightly, but due to the current regulations and pandemic situation, it would be impossible to do otherwise.

We trust that next year we'll all be able to meet and battle together.

See you on Saturday 7 January 2023!
