The Great Snowball Fight 2023 took place on the 7th of January, and it was a blast!
In particular:
- we had fun,
- we ate many beans,
- no non-regulatory avalanches swept the field,
- dodos were not insulted in any way,
- no finkling whatsoever took any place at all,
- nobody boiled goats in their mother's milk, thus keeping the tissue of spacetime safe and sound.

Thank you to all participants!
