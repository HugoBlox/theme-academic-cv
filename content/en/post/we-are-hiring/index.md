ISLab is opening a few postdoctoral positions for computer vision and/or machine learning researchers. 

## About ISLab

ISLab is a new research group at Osaka University, Japan, affiliated with [Institute for Datability Science (IDS)](https://www.ids.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/), Osaka University. Our mission includes providing the latest machine learning and data science techniques to other departments/institutes at Osaka University or any other organizations (e.g., universities and companies) through interdisciplinary collaborative research projects. 

ISLab is also affiliated with [Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Osaka University](https://www.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/english/), and we cultivate undergraduate and graduate students' skills and knowledge in computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing, and related fields. 

## Qualifications

We are looking for postdoctoral researchers who are an expert in and have some publications on (but not limited to):
- Deep learning
- Explainable AI
- Computational photography and imaging
- Probabilistic modeling
- Vision and language

## Your role

We have many projects on various topics, including application-specific ones involving our interdisciplinary collaborations and fundamental computer vision and machine learning ones, for example:

- Medial applications
- Digital humanities
- Affective computing
- Bias in neural networks and its mitigation

Please refer to [our website](https://www.is.ids.osaka-u.ac.jp/) for more details on some (but not all) of the projects. 

All our researchers and students are encouraged to submit papers to top conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICLR, ICCP, etc. (we have 5 papers at CVPR 2023 and 4 at CVPR 2022). We welcome researchers who can lead individual projects from the very beginning of their lifecycle (i.e., project proposals given a specific application or a topic) in collaboration with the faculty members. Interested researchers may advise undergraduate or graduate students. 

All our researchers can use 20% of their time for their own research projects and are encouraged to submit applications for funding. 

## Compensation

The salary is based on [the Osaka University's regulation](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/kitei/reiki_honbun/u035RG00000535.html?id=j21_k1) (Japanese only), basically around 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 JPY. Some taxes and insurance fees (including health and employment insurance) will be deducted. The university regulation also offers paid leaves. 

## Are you interested in working with us?

Please send your CV and research proposal to Prof. Hajime Nagahara at: contact<i class="fas fa-at"></i>is.ids.osaka-u.ac.jp (replace <i class="fas fa-at"></i> with @)

We welcome your application!
