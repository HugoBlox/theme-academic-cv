ISLab is opening a few postdoctoral positions for computer vision and/or machine learning researchers. Especially, we are looking for researchers who are expertized with and have some publications on:
- Deep learning
- Explainable AI
- Computational photography and imaging
- Probabilistic modeling
- Vision and language

We have many projects on various topics. Each postdoctoral researcher is assigned to some of these projects based on their preference and expertise. Our projects include:
- Medial applications
- Digital humanities
- Affective computing
- Bias in neural networks and its mitigation
  
Please refer to [our website](http://localhost:1313/#projects) for more details on some (but not all) of the projects . 

All our researchers and students are encouraged to submit papers to top conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICLR, ICCP, etc. (we have 5 papers at CVPR 2023 and 4 at CVPR 2022). We welcome researchers who can lead individual projects from the very beginning of their lifecycle (i.e., project proposals). Interested researchers may advice graduate students. Also, all our researchers can use 20% of their time for their own research project and are encouraged to submit applications for fundings. 


Are you interested in working with us? Please send your CV and research proposal to Prof. Hajime Nagahara at: contact<i class="fas fa-at"></i>is.ids.osaka-u.ac.jp (replace <i class="fas fa-at"></i> with @)

We welcome your application!
