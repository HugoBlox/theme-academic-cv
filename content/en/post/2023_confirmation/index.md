APAZAF is happy to announce that, after an intense reconnaissance session, which included real-world combat simulations,
the Great Snowball Fight is **CONFIRMED** for Saturday, 7th of January 2023!

The snow is not fresh, but it's good enough for some epic snow fighting to the last crystal!

Don't miss it, invite your friends (and enemies, so that you can hit them with snowballs), and don't forget to [register](/register), so that the organisation of provisions can occur smoothly.
See the [details page](/details) for all the necessary information.

Below you'll find a video and some pictures taken during yesterday's reconnaissance.
