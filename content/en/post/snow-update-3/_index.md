On January 2, a representative of APAZAF did a second reconnaissance visit to the Location. Here is what they determined:
- There is snow.
- The snow consists of: cold powdery snow, impossible to press into snowballs, covered by a relatively soft layer (containing some ice) which can support people weighing as much as 60 kg. Overall 40 to 70 cm thickness.
- The top layer is convenient to use by breaking it down and throwing the pieces as snowballs, and is not so hard as to hurt.

- The road to the parking spot will likely be very full on Saturday morning, and the road via Rivamonte looked a lot faster than the one via Voltago. The bravest among us should maybe take the dark valley about which it has been said "The way is shut. It was made by those who are Ticks, and the Ticks keep it.". Those who get there will get there first.
- The way up on foot is comfortable, both the path and the road alternate patches of snow with patches not of snow. The unpleasant side of the road is that there are also patches of ice, the path is on the otehr hand steep.
- It is impossible to use a bobsleigh, skis or similar items, due to the snowless patches.
