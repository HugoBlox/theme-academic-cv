Dear snowballers,

the [registrations](/register) for the 2022 edition of the Great Snowball Fight (GBPN) are now finally open!
Don't waste any time, register immediately to your favourite snowy event: it's free (for the Fight, a voluntary contribution is appreciated) and it only takes one minute!

The snow gods seem to be magnanimous this year, with plenty of snow already: more than 40cm have already [fallen](/snow) at the Battleground, near the Menegazzi Bivouac , and we sure hope it keeps on snowing this way!

We are looking forward to a Stupendous fight!
