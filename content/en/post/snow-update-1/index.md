Dear snowballers, good news!  
The weather has been terrible around Belluno in the last few days: lots of rain and a couple of very cold days and frosty nights.
Luckily for us, we are wise and can rejoice even in these dire circumstances, as this means that snow is already falling on the mountains and in vast amounts.
We have no direct information on the amount of snow at the Menegazzi bivouac, but:
 
- it is in the same area of the Scarpa--Gurekian hut,
- with the same exposition and
- at the same height.

So we can safely assume that the amount of snow at the hut is very similar to the amount of snow at our beloved battlesite.  
Conveniently, the hut (which is closed for the winter) has a very nice [webcam](https://www.rifuginrete.com/rifugio/scarpa/webcam/cam.jpg) and a weather station close by at Malga Losch, monitored by the [ARPAV](https://www.arpa.veneto.it/bollettini/meteo/h24/img00/Graf_390.htm?sens=LIVNEVE), the regional environment agency.

This is the situation as of yesterday night: more than 60cm of snow have already fallen!

Here are two good snapshot staken by the Scarpa--Gurekian hut webcam a few days ago:

In short, unless a very, very dry December is ahead of us, it is unlikely that all of this snow will melt away, and we'll have plenty of raw snowballing material!  

We also added a [snow status page](/snow) to the site, in which you'll always find up-to-date info and images.
