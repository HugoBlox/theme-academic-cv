abstract: Photometric stereo enables the estimation of surface normals from images
  that were captured using different known lighting directions. The classical photometric
  stereo method requires at least three images to determine the normals of a given
  scene. This method therefore cannot be applied to a dynamic scene, because it is
  assumed that the scene should remain static while the required images are captured.
  We present a dynamic photometric stereo method to estimate the surface normals in
  a dynamic scene. We use a multi-tap complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
  image sensor to capture the input images for the photometric stereo method. The
  image sensor can divide the electrons from the photodiode of a single pixel into
  different taps of exposures, and can therefore capture multiple images under different
  lighting conditions with almost the same timing. We implemented a prototype camera
  that was synchronized with a lighting system, and subsequently realized photometric
  stereo of a dynamic scene.
