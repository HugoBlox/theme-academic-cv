abstract: Politics has always gotten much attention throughout history, and video
  advertisement has become one of the most essential tools for political communication.
  Analysis of such political advertising videos can provide more insight into the
  political campaign by evaluating the message in it, such as a candidate's attitude
  toward a certain political issue. In this paper, we propose to classify the tone
  in political advertising videos into promotive, contrastive, and their mixture using
  a deep neural network to benefit automatic analysis of such videos. We especially
  explore how different modalities of videos, i.e., visuals, audio, and text, contribute
  to improving the classification accuracy.
