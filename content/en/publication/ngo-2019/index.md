abstract: Reflectance and shape are two important components in visually perceiving
  the real world. Inferring the reflectance and shape of an object through cameras
  is a fundamental research topic in the field of computer vision. While three-dimensional
  shape recovery is pervasive with varieties of approaches and practical applications,
  reflectance recovery has only emerged recently. Reflectance recovery is a challenging
  task that is usually conducted in controlled environments, such as a laboratory
  environment with a special apparatus. However, it is desirable that the reflectance
  be recovered in the field with a handy camera so that reflectance can be jointly
  recovered with the shape. To that end, we present a solution that simultaneously
  recovers the reflectance and shape (i.e., dense depth and normal maps) of an object
  under natural illumination with commercially available handy cameras. We employ
  a light field camera to capture one light field image of the object, and a 360-degree
  camera to capture the illumination. The proposed method provides positive results
  in both simulation and real-world experiments.
