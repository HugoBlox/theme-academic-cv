abstract: Student disengagement prediction in online learning environments is beneficial
  in various ways, especially to help provide timely cues to make some feedback or
  stimuli to the students. In this work, we propose a neural network-based model to
  predict students’ disengagement, as well as other behavioral cues, which might be
  relevant to students’ performance, using facial image sequences. For training and
  evaluating our model, we collected samples from multiple participants and annotated
  them with temporal segments of disengagement and other relevant behavioral cues
  with our multiple in-house annotators. We present prediction results of all behavior
  cues along with baseline comparison.
