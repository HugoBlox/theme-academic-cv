abstract: Â© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Automatic art analysis aims
  to classify and retrieve artistic representations from a collection of images by
  using computer vision and machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose
  to enhance visual representations from neural networks with contextual artistic
  information. Whereas visual representations are able to capture information about
  the content and the style of an artwork, our proposed context-aware embeddings additionally
  encode relationships between different artistic attributes, such as author, school,
  or historical period. We design two different approaches for using context in automatic
  art analysis. In the first one, contextual data is obtained through a multi-task
  learning model, in which several attributes are trained together to find visual
  relationships between elements. In the second approach, context is obtained through
  an art-specific knowledge graph, which encodes relationships between artistic attributes.
  An exhaustive evaluation of both of our models in several art analysis problems,
  such as author identification, type classification, or cross-modal retrieval, show
  that performance is improved by up to 7.3% in art classification and 37.24% in retrieval
  when context-aware embeddings are used.
