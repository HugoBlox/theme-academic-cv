abstract: 'Objectives To compare diagnostic performance for pulmonary invasive adenocarcinoma
  among radiologists with and without three-dimensional convolutional neural network
  (3D-CNN). Methods Enrolled were 285 patients with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS, n
  = 75), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA, n = 58), and invasive adenocarcinoma
  (IVA, n = 152). A 3D-CNN model was constructed with seven convolution-pooling and
  two max-pooling layers and fully connected layers, in which batch normalization,
  residual connection, and global average pooling were used. Only the flipping process
  was performed for augmentation. The output layer comprised two nodes for two conditions
  (AIS/MIA and IVA) according to prognosis. Diagnostic performance of the 3D-CNN model
  in 285 patients was calculated using nested 10-fold cross-validation. In 90 of 285
  patients, results from each radiologist (R1, R2, and R3; with 9, 14, and 26 years
  of experience, respectively) with and without the 3D-CNN model were statistically
  compared. Results Without the 3D-CNN model, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
  of the radiologists were as follows: R1, 70.0%, 52.1%, and 90.5%; R2, 72.2%, 75%,
  and 69%; and R3, 74.4%, 89.6%, and 57.1%, respectively. With the 3D-CNN model, accuracy,
  sensitivity, and specificity of the radiologists were as follows: R1, 72.2%, 77.1%,
  and 66.7%; R2, 74.4%, 85.4%, and 61.9%; and R3, 74.4%, 93.8%, and 52.4%, respectively.
  Diagnostic performance of each radiologist with and without the 3D-CNN model had
  no significant difference (p > 0.88), but the accuracy of R1 and R2 was significantly
  higher with than without the 3D-CNN model (p < 0.01). Conclusions The 3D-CNN model
  can support a less-experienced radiologist to improve diagnostic accuracy for pulmonary
  invasive adenocarcinoma without deteriorating any diagnostic performances. Key Points
  • The 3D-CNN model is a non-invasive method for predicting pulmonary invasive adenocarcinoma
  in CT images with high sensitivity. • Diagnostic accuracy by a less-experienced
  radiologist was better with the 3D-CNN model than without the model.'
