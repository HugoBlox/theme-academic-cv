abstract: 'Â© 2019 The Authors  Background: Biomedical imaging devices that utilize
  the optical characteristics of hemoglobin (Hb) have become widespread. In the field
  of gastroenterology, there is a strong demand for devices that can apply this technique
  to surgical navigation. We aimed to introduce our novel multispectral device capable
  of intraoperatively performing quantitative imaging of the oxygen (O 2 ) saturation
  and Hb amount of tissues noninvasively and in real time, and to examine its application
  for deciding the appropriate anastomosis point after subtotal or total esophagectomy.
  Materials and methods: A total of 39 patients with esophageal cancer were studied.
  Tissue O 2 saturation and Hb amount of the gastric tube just before esophagogastric
  anastomosis were evaluated using a multispectral tissue quantitative imaging device.
  The anastomosis point was decided depending on the quantitative values and patterns
  of both the tissue O 2 saturation and Hb amount. Results: The device can instantaneously
  and noninvasively quantify and visualize the tissue O 2 saturation and Hb amount
  using reflected light. The tissue Hb status could be classified into the following
  four types: good circulation type, congestion type, ischemia type, and mixed type
  of congestion and ischemia. Postoperative anastomotic failure occurred in 2 cases,
  and both were mixed cases. Conclusions: The method of quantitatively imaging the
  tissue O 2 saturation and Hb level in real time and noninvasively using a multispectral
  device allows instantaneous determination of the anastomosis and related organ conditions,
  thereby contributing to determining the appropriate treatment direction.'
