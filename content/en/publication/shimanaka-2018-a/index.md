abstract: Sentence representations can capture a wide range of information that cannot
  be captured by local features based on character or word N-grams. This paper examines
  the usefulness of universal sentence representations for evaluating the quality
  of machine translation. Al-though it is difficult to train sentence representations
  using small-scale translation datasets with manual evaluation, sentence representations
  trained from large-scale data in other tasks can improve the automatic evaluation
  of machine translation. Experimental results of the WMT-2016 dataset show that the
  proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with sentence representation
  features only.
