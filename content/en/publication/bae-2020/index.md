abstract: Commercially available light field cameras have difficulty in capturing
  5D (4D + time) light field videos. They can only capture still light field images
  or are excessively expensive for normal users to capture the light field video.
  To tackle this problem, we propose a deep learning-based method for synthesizing
  a light field video from a monocular video. We propose a new synthetic light field
  video dataset that renders photorealistic scenes using Unreal Engine because no
  light field video dataset is available. The proposed deep learning framework synthesizes
  the light field video with a full set (9x9) of sub-aperture images from a normal
  monocular video. The proposed network consists of three sub-networks, namely, feature
  extraction, 5D light field video synthesis, and temporal consistency refinement.
  Experimental results show that our model can successfully synthesize the light field
  video for synthetic and real scenes and outperforms the previous frame-by-frame
  method quantitatively and qualitatively.
