abstract: Â© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. Barcodes and 2D codes are widely
  used for various purposes, such as electronic payments and product management. Special
  code readers, and consumer smartphones can be used to scan codes; thus concerns
  about fraud and authenticity are important. Embedding watermarks in 2D codes, which
  allows simultaneous recognition and tamper detection by simply analyzing the captured
  pattern without requiring an additional device is considered a promising solution.
  However, smartphone cameras frequently suffer misfocus especially if the target
  object is too close to the lens, which makes the captured image defocused and results
  in failure to read watermarks. In this paper, we propose the use of a coded aperture
  imaging technique to recover watermarks. We have designed a coded aperture that
  is robust against defocus blur by optimizing the aperture pattern using a genetic
  algorithm. In addition, we have developed a programmable coded aperture that includes
  an actual optical process that works in an optimization loop; thus, the complicated
  effects of the optical aberrations can be considered. Experimental results demonstrate
  that the proposed method can extend the depth of field for watermark extraction
  to 3.1 times wider than that of a general circular aperture.
