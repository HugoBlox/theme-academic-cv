 abstract = {A light field can carry rich visual information of a real 3-D scene, leading to many attractive applications.
However, the acquisition of a light field is challenging due to the large amount of data. In our previous work, we proposed an
efficient method for this task using a coded-aperture camera with a convolutional neural network (CNN) which can computationally
reconstruct a light field from several images acquired with different aperture patterns. In this work, we report two
follow-up contributions to the previous work. First, we integrated a color filter array, which is common in RGB cameras, and
the related color processing into the algorithm pipeline. This integration led to better reconstruction quality for color light
fields. We then analyzed how the reconstruction quality obtained with our method was affected by the complexity of light
fields. We also showed the possibility of using this analysis to predict the reconstruction quality from the acquired images.},
