abstract: 'We propose a novel video understanding task by fusing knowledge-based and
  video question answering. First, we introduce KnowIT VQA, a video dataset with 24,282
  human-generated question-answer pairs about a popular sitcom. The dataset combines
  visual, textual and temporal coherence reasoning together with knowledge-based questions,
  which need of the experience obtained from the viewing of the series to be answered.
  Second, we propose a video understanding model by combining the visual and textual
  video content with specific knowledge about the show. Our main findings are: (i)
  the incorporation of knowledge produces outstanding improvements for VQA in video,
  and (ii) the performance on KnowIT VQA still lags well behind human accuracy, indicating
  its usefulness for studying current video modelling limitations.'
