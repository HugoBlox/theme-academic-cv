abstract: 'The increasing tendency to collect large and uncurated datasets to train
  vision-and-language models has raised concerns about fair representations. It is
  known that even small but manually annotated datasets, such as MSCOCO, are affected
  by societal bias. This problem, far from being solved, may be getting worse with
  data crawled from the Internet without much control. In addition, the lack of tools
  to analyze societal bias in big collections of images makes addressing the problem
  extremely challenging. Our first contribution is to annotate part of the Google
  Conceptual Captions dataset, widely used for training vision-and-language models,
  with four demographic and two contextual attributes. Our second contribution is
  to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the annotations, focusing on how different
  demographic groups are represented. Our last contribution lies in evaluating three
  prevailing vision-and-language tasks: image captioning, text-image CLIP embeddings,
  and text-to-image generation, showing that societal bias is a persistent problem
  in all of them.'
