abstract: Automatically generating a summary of a sports video poses the challenge
  of detecting interesting moments, or highlights, of a game. Traditional sports video
  summarization methods leverage editing conventions of broadcast sports video that
  facilitate the extraction of high-level semantics. However, user-generated videos
  are not edited and, thus, traditional methods are not suitable to generate a summary.
  In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel video summarization
  method that uses players' actions as a cue to determine the highlights of the original
  video. A deep neural-network-based approach is used to extract two types of action-related
  features and to classify video segments into interesting or uninteresting parts.
  The proposed method can be applied to any sports in which games consist of a succession
  of actions. Especially, this paper considers the case of Kendo (Japanese fencing)
  as an example of a sport to evaluate the proposed method. The method is trained
  using Kendo videos with ground truth labels that indicate the video highlights.
  The labels are provided by annotators possessing a different experience with respect
  to Kendo to demonstrate how the proposed method adapts to different needs. The performance
  of the proposed method is compared with several combinations of different features,
  and the results show that it outperforms previous summarization methods.
