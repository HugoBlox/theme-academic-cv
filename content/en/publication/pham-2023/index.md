abstract: 'In this paper, we present a prototype pseudo-direct time-of-flight (ToF)
  CMOS image sensor, achieving high distance accuracy, precision, and robustness to
  multipath interference. An indirect ToF (iToF)-based image sensor, which enables
  high spatial resolution, is used to acquire temporal compressed signals in the charge
  domain. Whole received light waveforms, like those acquired with conventional direct
  ToF (dToF) image sensors, can be obtained after image reconstruction based on compressive
  sensing. Therefore, this method has the advantages of both dToF and iToF depth image
  sensors, such as high resolution, high accuracy, immunity to multipath interference,
  and the absence of motion artifacts. Additionally, two approaches to refine the
  depth resolution are explained: (1) the introduction of a sub-time window; and (2)
  oversampling in image reconstruction and quadratic fitting in the depth calculation.
  Experimental results show the separation of two reflections 40 cm apart under multipath
  interference conditions and a significant improvement in distance precision down
  to around 1 cm. Point cloud map videos demonstrate the improvements in depth resolution
  and accuracy. These results suggest that the proposed method could be a promising
  approach for virtually implementing dToF imaging suitable for challenging environments
  with multipath interference.'
