abstract: We introduce the RUSE metric for the WMT18 metrics shared task. Sentence
  embeddings can capture global information that cannot be captured by local features
  based on character or word N-grams. Although training sentence embeddings using
  small-scale translation datasets with manual evaluation is difficult, sentence embeddings
  trained from large-scale data in other tasks can improve the automatic evaluation
  of machine translation. We use a multi-layer perceptron regressor based on three
  types of sentence embeddings. The experimental results of the WMT16 and WMT17 datasets
  show that the RUSE metric achieves a state-of-the-art performance in both segment-
  and system-level metrics tasks with embedding features only.
