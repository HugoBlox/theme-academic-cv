abstract: Detection followed by projection in conventional privacy cameras is vulnerable
  to software attacks that threaten to expose image sensor data. By multiplexing the
  incoming light with a coded mask, a FlatCam camera removes the spatial correlation
  and captures visually protected images. However, FlatCam imaging suffers from poor
  reconstruction quality and pays no attention to the privacy of visual information.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based compressive sensing approach to
  reconstruct and protect sensitive regions from secured FlatCam measurements. We
  predict sensitive regions via facial segmentation and separate them from the captured
  measurements. Our deep compressive sensing network was trained with simulated data,
  and was tested on both simulated and real FlatCam data.
