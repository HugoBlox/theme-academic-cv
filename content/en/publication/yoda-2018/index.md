abstract: The photometric stereo method enables estimation of surface normals from
  images that have been captured using different but known lighting directions. The
  classical photometric stereo method requires at least three images to determine
  the normals in a given scene. However, this method cannot be applied to dynamic
  scenes because it is assumed that the scene remains static while the required images
  are captured. In this work, we present a dynamic photometric stereo method for estimation
  of the surface normals in a dynamic scene. We use a multi-tap complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
  (CMOS) image sensor to capture the input images required for the proposed photometric
  stereo method. This image sensor can divide the electrons from the photodiode from
  a single pixel into the different taps of the exposures and can thus capture multiple
  images under different lighting conditions with almost identical timing. We implemented
  a camera lighting system and created a software application to enable estimation
  of the normal map in real time. We also evaluated the accuracy of the estimated
  surface normals and demonstrated that our proposed method can estimate the surface
  normals of dynamic scenes.
