abstract: Â© 2017 SPIE. Hyperspectral imaging is used in various fields because it
  can obtain much more information than imaging by conventional RGB cameras. Hyperspectral
  imaging systems using active illumination, prisms, gratings, or narrowband filters
  have been proposed. Active illumination systems can obtain two-dimensional (2D)
  spectral images rapidly, and the device can be low-cost and small because of the
  use of LEDs. However, flicker can occur when different colors of LEDs are switched.
  The other methods do not have the flicker problem because they use passive imaging.
  However, these systems take a long time to acquire the 2D spectral images, or they
  tend to be high-cost or large. In our research, we propose a flickerless active
  LED illumination system for hyperspectral imaging. This system acquires images while
  switching the illumination. The switching illumination consists of many narrowband
  LEDs that have different spectrums. The spectral images of each LED are reconstructed
  from the acquired images. The switching illumination is designed to reduce the flicker
  based on human visual characteristics. We reduce the color changes of the switching
  illumination while maintaining its spectral differences. In the experiment, we obtain
  the optimal design of a flickerless illumination system for measuring oxygen saturation.
  To show the feasibility of our system, we clearly show the difference in saturation
  using the spectral images obtained by a prototype designed using the proposed method.
