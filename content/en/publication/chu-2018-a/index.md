abstract: A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text in other words. Paraphrases
  have been studied to enhance the performance of many natural language processing
  tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel task iParaphrasing to extract visually
  grounded paraphrases (VGPs), which are different phrasal expressions describing
  the same visual concept in an image. These extracted VGPs have the potential to
  improve language and image multimodal tasks such as visual question answering and
  image captioning. How to model the similarity between VGPs is the key of iParaphrasing.
  We apply various existing methods as well as propose a novel neural network-based
  method with image attention, and report the results of the first attempt toward
  iParaphrasing.
