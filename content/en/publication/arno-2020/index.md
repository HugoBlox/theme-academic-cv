abstract: Monitoring cell-state transition in pluripotent cells is invaluable for
  application and basic research. In this study, we demonstrate the pertinence of
  noninvasive, label-free Raman spectroscopy to monitor and characterize the cell-state
  transition of mouse stem cells undergoing reprogramming. Using an isogenic cell
  line of mouse stem cells, reprogramming from neuronal cells was performed, and we
  showcase a comparative analysis of living single-cell spectral data of the original
  stem cells, their neuronal progenitors, and reprogrammed cells. Neural network,
  regression models, and ratiometric analyses were used to discriminate the cell states
  and extract several important biomarkers specific to differentiation or reprogramming.
  Our results indicated that the Raman spectrum allowed us to build a low-dimensional
  space allowing us to monitor and characterize the dynamics of cell-state transition
  at a single-cell level, scattered in heterogeneous populations. The ability of monitoring
  pluripotency by Raman spectroscopy and distinguishing differences between ES and
  reprogrammed cells is also discussed.
