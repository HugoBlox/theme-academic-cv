abstract: 'Video question answering (VideoQA) is designed to answer a given question
  based on a relevant video clip. The current available large-scale datasets have
  made it possible to formulate VideoQA as the joint understanding of visual and language
  information. However, this training procedure is costly and still less competent
  with human performance. In this paper, we investigate a transfer learning method
  by the introduction of domain-agnostic knowledge and domain-specific knowledge.
  First, we develop a novel transfer learning framework, which finetunes the pre-trained
  model by applying domain-agnostic knowledge as the medium. Second, we construct
  a new VideoQA dataset with 21,412 human-generated question-answer samples for comparable
  transfer of knowledge. Our experiments show that: (i) domain-agnostic knowledge
  is transferable and (ii) our proposed transfer learning framework can boost VideoQA
  performance effectively.'
