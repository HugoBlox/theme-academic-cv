abstract: Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is associated
  with more frequent cancer recurrence and metastasis. Sensitive sensing of HER2 in
  living breast cancer cells is crucial in the early stages of cancer and to further
  understand its role in cells. Biomedical imaging has become an indispensable tool
  in the fields of early cancer diagnosis and therapy. In this study, we designed
  and synthesized platinum (Pt) nanocluster bionanoprobes with red emission (Ex/Em
  = 535/630 nm) for fluorescence imaging of HER2. Our Pt nanoclusters, which were
  synthesized using polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer and preequilibration, exhibited
  approximately 1% quantum yield and possessed low cytotoxicity, ultrasmall size,
  and excellent photostability. Furthermore, combined with ProteinA as an adapter
  protein, we developed Pt bionanoprobes with minimal nonspecific binding and utilized
  them as fluorescent probes for highly sensitive optical imaging of HER2 at the cellular
  level. More importantly, molecular probes with long-wavelength emission have allowed
  visualization of deep anatomical features because of enhanced tissue penetration
  and a decrease in background noise from tissue scattering. Our Pt nanoclusters are
  promising fluorescent probes for biomedical applications.
