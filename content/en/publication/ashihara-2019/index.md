abstract: 'Lexical substitution ranks substitution candidates from the viewpoint of
  paraphrasability for a target word in a given sentence. There are two major approaches
  for lexical substitution: (1) generating contextualized word embeddings by assigning
  multiple embeddings to one word and (2) generating context embeddings using the
  sentence. Herein we propose a method that combines these two approaches to contextualize
  word embeddings for lexical substitution. Experiments demonstrate that our method
  outperforms the current state-of-the-art method. We also create CEFR-LP, a new evaluation
  dataset for the lexical substitution task. It has a wider coverage of substitution
  candidates than previous datasets and assigns English proficiency levels to all
  target words and substitution candidates.'
