abstract: 'To understand movies, humans constantly reason over the dialogues and actions
  shown in specific scenes and relate them to the overall storyline already seen.
  Inspired by this behaviour, we design ROLL, a model for knowledge-based video story
  question answering that leverages three crucial aspects of movie understanding:
  dialog comprehension, scene reasoning, and storyline recalling. In ROLL, each of
  these tasks is in charge of extracting rich and diverse information by 1) processing
  scene dialogues, 2) generating unsupervised video scene descriptions, and 3) obtaining
  external knowledge in a weakly supervised fashion. To answer a given question correctly,
  the information generated by each inspired-cognitive task is encoded via Transformers
  and fused through a modality weighting mechanism, which balances the information
  from the different sources. Exhaustive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
  of our approach, which yields a new state-of-the-art on two challenging video question
  answering datasets: KnowIT VQA and TVQA+.'
