abstract: "With the spread of high-performance sensors and social network services\
  \ (SNS) and the remarkable advances in machine learning technologies, fake media\
  \ such as fake videos, spoofed voices, and fake reviews that are generated using\
  \ high-quality learning data and are very close to the real thing are causing serious\
  \ social problems. We launched a research project, the Media Clone (MC) project,\
  \ to protect receivers of replicas of real media called media clones (MCs) skillfully\
  \ fabricated by means of media processing technologies. Our aim is to achieve a\
  \ communication system that can defend against MC attacks and help ensure safe and\
  \ reliable communication. This paper describes the results of research in two of\
  \ the five themes in the MC project: 1) verification of the capability of generating\
  \ various types of media clones such as audio, visual, and text derived from fake\
  \ information and 2) realization of a protection shield for media clones' attacks\
  \ by recognizing them."
