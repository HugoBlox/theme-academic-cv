abstract: "With the spread of high-performance sensors and social network services
  (SNS) and the remarkable advances in machine learning technologies, fake media such
  as fake videos, spoofed voices, and fake reviews that are generated using high-quality
  learning data and are very close to the real thing are causing serious social problems.
  We launched a research project, the Media Clone (MC) project, to protect receivers
  of replicas of real media called media clones (MCs) skillfully fabricated by means
  of media processing technologies. Our aim is to achieve a communication system that
  can defend against MC attacks and help ensure safe and reliable communication. This
  paper describes the results of research in two of the five themes in the MC project:
  1) verification of the capability of generating various types of media clones such
  as audio, visual, and text derived from fake information and 2) realization of a
  protection shield for media clones' attacks by recognizing them."
