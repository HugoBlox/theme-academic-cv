abstract: Deep hashing has been widely used to approximate nearest-neighbor search
  for image retrieval tasks. Most of them are trained with image-label pairs without
  any inter-label relationship, which may not make full use of the real-world data.
  This paper presents deep hashing, named HA2SH, that leverages multiple types of
  labels with hierarchical structures that an ethnological museum assigns to their
  artifacts. We experimentally prove that HA2SH can learn to generate hashes that
  give a better retrieval performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wbw520/minpaku.
