abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for constructing a large corpus about
  a century of public meetings in historical Australian newspapers, and analyze the
  constructed corpus. The corpus construction method is based on image processing
  and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). We digitize and transcribe texts of the
  specific topic of public meeting. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves
  a F-score of 71.5% with a high recall of 97.5% for corpus construction. This allows
  us to feed a content search tool for temporal and semantic content analysis.
