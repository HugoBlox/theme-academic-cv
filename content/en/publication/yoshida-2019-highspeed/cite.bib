 abstract = {Several recent studies on compressive video sensing realized scene capture beyond the fundamental trade-off limit between spatial resolution and temporal resolution using random space-time sampling. However, most of these studies obtained results for higher-frame-rate video that was produced in simulation experiments or using an optically simulated random sampling camera, because there are currently no commercially available image sensors with random exposure or sampling capabilities. We fabricated a prototype complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor with quasi pixel-wise exposure timing that can realize nonuniform space-time sampling. The prototype sensor resets exposures independently by columns and fixes these exposures by rows for each 8 Ã— 8-pixel block. This CMOS sensor is not fully controllable the pixels and has line-dependent control, but offers greater flexibility when compared with regular CMOS or charge-coupled device sensors with global or rolling shutters. We propose a method of realizing pseudo-random sampling for high-speed video acquisition that uses the flexibility of the CMOS sensor. We reconstruct the high-speed video sequence from images produced in pseudo-random sampling using a pre-learned decoder.},
