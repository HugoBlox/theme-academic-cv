abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) approaches, mostly neural network-based, are assuming
  that the pre-trained knowledge can be obtained from base (seen) categories and transferred
  to novel (unseen) categories. However, the black-box nature of neural networks makes
  it difficult to understand what is actually transferred, which may hamper its application
  in some risk-sensitive areas. In this paper, we reveal a new way to perform explainable
  FSL for image classification, using discriminative patterns and pairwise matching.
  Experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve satisfactory explainability
  on two mainstream datasets. Code is available*.
