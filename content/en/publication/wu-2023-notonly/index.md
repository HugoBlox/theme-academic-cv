abstract: 'The duality of content and style is inherent to the nature of art. For
  humans, these two elements are clearly different: content refers to the objects
  and concepts in the piece of art, and style to the way it is expressed. This duality
  poses an important challenge for computer vision. The visual appearance of objects
  and concepts is modulated by the style that may reflect the authorâ€™s emotions, social
  trends, artistic movement, etc., and their deep comprehension undoubtfully requires
  to handle both. A promising step towards a general paradigm for art analysis is
  to disentangle content and style, whereas relying on human annotations to cull a
  single aspect of artworks has limitations in learning semantic concepts and the
  visual appearance of paintings. We thus present GOYA, a method that distills the
  artistic knowledge captured in a recent generative model to disentangle content
  and style. Experiments show that synthetically generated images sufficiently serve
  as a proxy of the real distribution of artworks, allowing GOYA to separately represent
  the two elements of art while keeping more information than existing methods.'
