abstract: © 2018 The Author(s) Alleles of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A DNAs are
  classified and expressed graphically by using artificial intelligence “Deep Learning
  (Stacked autoencoder)”. Nucleotide sequence data corresponding to the length of
  822 bp, collected from the Immuno Polymorphism Database, were compressed to 2-dimensional
  representation and were plotted. Profiles of the two-dimensional plots indicate
  that the alleles can be classified as clusters are formed. The two-dimensional plot
  of HLA-A DNAs gives a clear outlook for characterizing the various alleles.
