abstract: Human pose estimation is a well-known problem in computer vision to locate
  joint positions. Existing datasets for the learning of poses are observed to be
  not challenging enough in terms of pose diversity, object occlusion, and viewpoints.
  This makes the pose annotation process relatively simple and restricts the application
  of the models that have been trained on them. To handle more variety in human poses,
  we propose the concept of fine-grained hierarchical pose classification, in which
  we formulate the pose estimation as a classification task, and propose a dataset,
  Yoga-82, for large-scale yoga pose recognition with 82 classes. Yoga-82 consists
  of complex poses where fine annotations may not be possible. To resolve this, we
  provide hierarchical labels for yoga poses based on the body configuration of the
  pose. The dataset contains a three-level hierarchy including body positions, variations
  in body positions, and the actual pose names. We present the classification accuracy
  of the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures on Yoga-82. We
  also present several hierarchical variants of DenseNet in order to utilize the hierarchical
  labels.
