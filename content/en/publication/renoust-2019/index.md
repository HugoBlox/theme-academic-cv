abstract: Â© 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). While Buddhism has spread
  along the Silk Roads, many pieces of art have been displaced. Only a few experts
  may identify these works, subjectively to their experience. The construction of
  Buddha statues was taught through the definition of canon rules, but the applications
  of those rules greatly varies across time and space. Automatic art analysis aims
  at supporting these challenges. We propose to automatically recover the proportions
  induced by the construction guidelines, in order to use them and compare between
  different deep learning features for several classification tasks, in a medium size
  but rich dataset of Buddha statues, collected with experts of Buddhism art history.
