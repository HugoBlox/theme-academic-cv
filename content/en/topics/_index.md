ISLab is working on making "Self-contained" intelligence, where we consider an intelligence is self-contained if it comes with capabilities of **sensing** to observe the environment including people, **understanding** to make decision considering various context, and **action** to interact/change the environment.

We have been working on a wide range of topics related to computational phography, computer vision, natural language processing, human sensing, etc., that involve these essential capabilities of "self-contained" intelligence. Some of them are introduced here.
