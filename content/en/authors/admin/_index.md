      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm Nguyen Thanh Huy, a backend software engineer with a strong focus on building stable, high-performance systems that meet real-world business needs.

With experience in designing and maintaining backend services, Iâ€™ve worked on systems that handle high volumes of transactions, integrate with multiple external APIs, and follow modern software architecture principles such as microservices and domain-driven design. Iâ€™m proficient in technologies like .NET, Redis, MongoDB, Kafka, and Elasticsearch, and I'm comfortable working in fast-paced, production-critical environments.

Beyond day-to-day development, I care about writing clean, maintainable code and applying best practices in performance optimization, scalability, and data consistency. I also have hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines, Docker-based deployments, and monitoring tools to ensure reliability at scale.

I believe that good software is not only about code, but about solving problems, improving user experience, and delivering long-term value. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful projects.
