You can make changes on the files and then make pull requests, with branch name `dev`. After reviewing, your changes can be merged to `master`, which will be published. 

## Publication list

The Publication list is updated sometimes manually based on the information in our Mendeley group. Don't change it directly. 

### Rules when adding your papers to Mendeley:
- All author names should be full spelled. Otherwise, the papers are not listed in your profile page.
- Only the first words in title should be capitalized, like: `An image has RGB channels`. We can automatically capitalize all words. The other way around is difficult. 
- Month and year of publication should be specified for sorting in the chronological order.

### Recommendation when adding your paper to Mendeley:
- ArXiv url can be provided. This automatically generates link to it.
- Adding abstract of the paper is strongly encouraged to show it in an individual paper's page.
