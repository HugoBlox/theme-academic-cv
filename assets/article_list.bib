abstract = {This paper presents an empirical assessment of four state-of-the-art risk-averse approaches to deal with the capacitated lot-sizing problem under stochastic demand. We analyse two mean-risk models based on the semideviation and on the conditional value-at-risk risk measures, and alternate first and second-order stochastic dominance approaches. The extensive computational experiments based on different instances characteristics and on a case-study suggest that CVaR exhibits a good trade-off between risk and performance, followed by the semideviation and first-order stochastic dominance approach. For all approaches, enforcing risk-aversion helps to reduce the cost-standard deviation substantially, which is usually accomplished via increasing production rates. Overall, we can say that very risk-averse decision-makers would be willing to pay an increased price to have a much less risky solution given by CVaR. In less risk-averse settings, though, semideviation and first-order stochastic dominance can be appealing alternatives to provide significantly more stable production planning costs with a marginal increase of the expected costs.},

The G-VRP models the optimal routing of an alternative fuel vehicle fleet to serve a set of geographically scattered customers. Vehicles’ fuel autonomy and possible refueling stops en route are explicitly modeled and maximum duration constraints are imposed on each vehicle route. We model the G-VRP as a set partitioning problem in which columns represent feasible routes corresponding to simple circuits in a multigraph. Each node in the multigraph represents one customer and each arc between two customers represents a nondominated path through a set of refueling stations visited by a vehicle when traveling directly between the two customers. We strengthen the set partitioning formulation by adding valid inequalities including k-path cuts and describe a method for separating them. We provide computational results on benchmark instances showing that the algorithm can optimally solve instances with up to ∼110 customers.},

Moreover, using global optimization algorithms is often not feasible because they typically require large computational efforts. This paper proposes the use of convex relaxations based on McCormick envelopes for the Refinery Operations Planning Problem (ROPP) that can be used to generate both initial solutions for the ROPP and to estimate optimality gaps for the solutions obtained. The results obtained using data from a real-world refinery suggest that the proposed approach can provide reasonably good solutions for the ROPP, even for cases in which there was no solution available using traditional local NLP algorithms. Furthermore, compared with a global optimization solver, the proposed heuristic is capable of obtaining better solutions in less computational time.},

This dual is widely used in decomposition methods for the solution of SMIPs. The algorithm relies on the well-known progressive hedging method, but unlike previous progressive hedging approaches for SMIP, our algorithm can be shown to converge to the optimal Lagrangian dual value. The key improvement in the new algorithm is an inner loop of optimized linearization steps, similar to those taken in the classical Frank–Wolfe method. Numerical results demonstrate that our new algorithm empirically outperforms the standard implementation of progressive hedging for obtaining bounds in SMIP.},

abstract = {We contribute improvements to a Lagrangian dual solution approach applied to large-scale optimization problems whose objective functions are convex, continuously differentiable and possibly nonlinear, while the non-relaxed constraint set is compact but not necessarily convex. Such problems arise, for example, in the split-variable deterministic reformulation of stochastic mixed-integer optimization problems. The dual solution approach needs to address the nonconvexity of the non-relaxed constraint set while being efficiently implementable in parallel. We adapt the augmented Lagrangian method framework to address the presence of nonconvexity in the non-relaxed constraint set and the need for efficient parallelization. The development of our approach is most naturally compared with the development of proximal bundle methods and especially with their use of serious step conditions. However, deviations from these developments allow for an improvement in efficiency with which parallelization can be utilized. Pivotal in our modification to the augmented Lagrangian method is the use of an integration of approaches based on the simplicial decomposition method (SDM) and the nonlinear block Gauss-Seidel (GS) method. An adaptation of a serious step condition associated with proximal bundle methods allows for the approximation tolerance to be automatically adjusted. Under mild conditions optimal dual convergence is proven, and we report computational results on test instances from the stochastic optimization literature. We demonstrate improvement in parallel speedup over a baseline parallel approach.},

The model aims at solution robustness (or stability) and intends to enhance and support the decision-making process of a real-world ETO industrial setting. Monte Carlo simulation is employed to assess the simultaneous impact of multiple constraints on the robustness of the generated solutions. The computational results are adherent to the industry setting studied and show the effects of the conservatism level on the optimal values of the generated plans.

The academic literature, in this area, presents a research-practice gap with a lack of studies on the application of decision support tools to address capacity planning problems in real-world ETO settings. To reduce this gap, this paper presents the findings from an action research on the application of an optimization model to support tactical capacity planning in a medium-sized project-driven ETO organization. To properly model the studied environment, the proposed solution includes the representation of overlapping and variable intensity activities and the use of nonregular capacity options (e.g., overtime, hiring workers, subcontracting). The model was fed with real-world data and solved in order to check whether it actually reflects the planning problem. Furthermore, alternative scenarios were also generated to assist the management board in the order acceptance phase. As for practical implications, for the company manufacturing team, the modeĺs application enhanced the decision-making process regarding tactical capacity planning, addressing different shortcomings of the current planning method. Moreover, the proposed solution represents a diagnostic and decision support tool because it helps this team to identify the potential gaps between capacity and demand and also it demonstrates how to adapt capacity to demand and how to optimally balance demand. From an academic perspective, this research adds empirical evidence to enrich the existing literature, as it not only presents a real case application, but also highlights issues that either are not entirely explored in other studies or must be adapted to properly model a specific but real-world production setting.},

However, stochastic models can lead to decisions that consider solely expected values and thus neglect the eventual damage associated with the worst-case scenarios of a disaster. Two-stage stochastic optimization can lead to solutions that present relief supply shortages that could be often prevented. Bearing this in mind, models with risk aversion have been proposed to make decisions that are better suited to humanitarian operations. In this paper, we propose a model for pre-positioning, location and distribution that uses the measure of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to better attend to affected people in a disaster. A post-optimization analysis is conducted to evaluate the quality of the solution. The results indicate that a risk-aversion profile can lead to a 100{\%} reduction of shortages that can be avoided.},

In addition, to achieve better customer services, we introduce a variable rationing rule to address quantities of the item in short. The devised models are reformulated into their deterministic equivalent, resulting in nonlinear mixed-integer programming models, which are then approximately linearized. To deal with the uncertain nature of the item demand levels, we apply a Monte Carlo simulation-based method to generate finite and discrete sets of scenarios. Moreover, the proposed approach does not require restricted assumptions to the behavior of the probabilistic phenomena, as does several existing methods in the literature. Numerical experiments with the proposed approach for randomly generated instances of the problem show results with errors around 1{\%}.},

abstract = {The inventory control system consists of defining strategies to manage inventory replenishment such that costs involved in ordering, holding, and meeting the demands are optimized. Although several methods for inventory management are proposed in the literature, the assumptions made necessary can hinder their applicability in practice. Motivated by this fact, we propose a methodology for determining the optimal parameters of an inventory control system for single-item one-echelon supply chains using two-stage stochastic programming, considering periodic review and uncertain demand. The proposed approach is flexible enough to consider backlogs or lost sales cases without limitations on the number of outstanding orders and allows the consideration of uncertainties in a more comprehensive manner when compared to currently available methods. The optimal review periodicity and the inventory target level are determined using a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model, which takes into account the uncertain nature of the item demand levels through a finite set of scenarios. We present how this model can be reformulated as a deterministic equivalent mixed-integer linear programing model and how the Sample Average Approximation method can be used to incorporate the uncertainty into it. To validate the proposed approach, we perform a simulation-based sensitivity analysis in the neighborhood of the solutions obtained. We also compare them with those obtained applying the Hadley-Whitin method, considering the premises that are necessary for the later. Further, we present results from a case in which the stochastic demand is not stationary. The results obtained provide strong evidence of the potential of the proposed approach.},

The uncertain demand and the perishable nature of blood units can result in over- or under-stocking and increase wastage and shortage costs. In this study, we analyze how a proactive transshipment policy can avoid future shortages in addition to mitigate wastage. We consider a network of hospitals with uncertain demand in which each hospital makes decisions on the quantity to order from a central blood bank and to transship to other hospitals in each review period. We formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic programming model. To generate scenarios, the Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling approach is employed and the optimal number of scenarios is determined by conducting stability tests. We performed numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and investigate the potential benefits of the outlined proactive transshipment. The developed model is used to compare the optimized policy with the current practice in some hospitals in Australia and with a no-transshipment policy. The numerical results indicate significant potential cost savings in comparison with the current policy in use and the no-transshipment policy.},

abstract = {Managing inventories in the blood supply chain is a challenging task, mainly due to the uncertain nature of the demand for blood units, the perishable nature of the blood, and a strong subjective bias towards criteria other than cost minimisation. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming model for defining optimal periodic review policies for red blood cells inventory management that focus on minimising operational costs, as well as blood shortage and wastage due to outdating, taking into account perishability and demand uncertainty. The adoption of this framework allows the consideration of more general stochastic processes to model the demand uncertainty than approaches currently available in literature. Moreover, this framework renders a model that can be solved efficiently by general purpose off-the-shelf optimisation software. To illustrate the potential benefits of adopting the proposed model to support the definition of optimal blood inventory control policies, a case study is presented considering realistic data representing the daily demand for blood, which was generated using the average and standard deviation of the demand for eight types of blood. Results suggest meaningful insights concerning practices that could lead to improvement in the blood supply chain performance. In particular, we observed that it would be possible to revise the current inventory control policies by reducing current target levels to diminish wastage and total cost without compromising the service level. Finally, the consideration of blood substitutions showed further improvement in the performance of the blood inventory management system.},

Results: We first examine (a) interpreters' management and performance of others' emotions, (b) interpreters' management and performance of their own emotions, and (c) impacts of emotion work for healthcare interpreters. Conclusion: By problematizing the roles and functions of emotion and emotion work in interpreter-mediated medical encounters, we propose a normative model to guide future research and practices of interpreters' emotion management in cross-cultural care. Practice implications: Quality and equality of care should serve as the guiding principle for interpreters' decision-making about their emotions and emotion work. Rather than adopting a predetermined practice, interpreters should evaluate and prioritize the various clinical, interpersonal, and therapeutic objectives as they consider the best practice in managing their own and other speakers' emotions.

This study presents a practical use for technologies, such as a thermohydraulic simulation of gas flow through pipelines, a Monte Carlo simulation for compressor station availability studies, an economic risk evaluation related to potential revenue losses and contractual penalties and linear programming for the maximisation of income and the minimisation of contractual penalties. The proposed system allows the optimum availability level to be defined and maintained by the Transporter (by installing reserve capacity) to mitigate losses related to revenue and contractual penalties. It also economically identifies, quantifies and justifies the installation of stand-by compressor units that can mitigate the Transporter's exposure to losses caused by capacity shortfalls as a consequence of scheduled and non-scheduled outages. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Given this context, the use of a decision support system (DSS), which encompasses the complexity of the oil supply chain to support investment decisions, becomes crucial. This paper proposes a DSS that is based on a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that allows the evaluation of different investment alternatives in logistics networks, such as expanding the capacity for transport, handling, and/or storage. Additionally, the DSS is composed of a database structure, business intelligence environment, and graphical visualization tool. The features of the proposed system were evaluated in two case studies. The first case study assesses the synergies between two projects: specifically the expansion of the berthing capacity of vessels in a marine terminal, and the increase in the transport capacity of the pipeline that connects the marine terminal to a distribution base. The second case study evaluates the dependency of the investment in sections of a pipeline that connects a refinery to several distribution bases. These case studies demonstrate the potential use of a DSS that currently optimizes investments in the Brazilian petroleum supply chain.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Vector control, particularly distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), constitutes one of the major pathways to prevent and reduce malaria transmission. ITN distribution campaigns face several challenges, such as inadequate funding, budgetary constraints, hard-to-reach areas, limited transportation, and market and price volatility. While long-term agreements and proper planning can effectively overcome such challenges, those options may not be available for all humanitarian organizations and governments. To gain a better understanding of such tradeoffs we develop a robust optimization model that minimize ITN distribution costs while taking into consideration protection against financial, market and logistical uncertainties. The simultaneous account of such uncertainties is rarely seen on the humanitarian supply chain design literature. The proposed robust model explores data-driven adaptive uncertainty sets that capture the dependence structure among procurement and distribution costs, leading to plausible uncertain scenarios. In addition, we develop a hierarchical optimization approach to ease the burden of setting a specific robustness level for each constraint, when uncertainties are related to the independent terms. We study a United Nations Children's Fund ITN distribution campaign in Ivory Coast, observing that (1) total costs increase with campaign robustness, as expected, and (2) campaign robustness comprises of improved supply chain flexibility, which might minimize efforts if it becomes necessary to adjust procurement and transportation plans when uncertainty arises. In addition, assessing robust solutions through Monte Carlo simulations against several realizations of uncertain parameter values indicates that, as desired, robust plan feasibility increases with the specified level of conservatism.},

abstract = {Medical drug shortages are an important issue in health care, since they can significantly affect patients' health. Thus, selecting the appropriate distribution and inventory policies plays an important role in decreasing drug shortages. In this context, inventory routing models can be used to determine optimal policies in the context of medical drug distribution. However, in real-world conditions, some parameters in these models are subject to uncertainty. This paper examines the effects of uncertainty in the demand by relying on a two-stage stochastic programming approach to incorporate it into the optimization model. A two-stage model is then proposed and two different approaches based on chance constraints are used to assess the validity of the proposed model. In the first model, a scenario-based two-stage stochastic programming model without probabilistic constraint is proposed, while in the other two models, proposed for validation of the first model, probabilistic constraints are considered. A mathematical-programming based algorithm (a matheuristic) is proposed for solving the models. Moreover, the Latin hypercube sampling method is employed to generate scenarios for the scenario-based models. Numerical examples show the necessity of considering the stochastic nature of the problem and the accuracy of the proposed models and solution method.},

In this context, the use of hydrogen as a fuel has been considered an alternative with significant potential to integrate a more sustainable energy matrix. However, there is still no appropriate infrastructure available for its commercialization. This study proposes a methodology for designing a hydrogen supply chain while considering the inherent uncertainty associated with the demand for this fuel in the future. To represent the problem and evaluate investment alternatives for the logistic infrastructure, an optimization model is proposed based on two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming. To obtain solutions from the proposed model, the sample average approximation (SAA) method is used to obtain statistically certified solutions from a reduced number of scenarios. The proposed methodology was applied to the design of Great Britain's liquid hydrogen supply chain using real data. The proposed framework was able to provide solutions with optimality gaps estimated to be below 1{\%} within an acceptable computational time, demonstrating the adequacy of the developed methodology.},

The problem consists of a multi-product plant scheduling, with two serial machine stages-a mixer and a set of tanks-which have resource constraints and operate on a continuous flow basis. Two models were developed: the first using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and the second using genetic algorithms (GA). Their main objective was to meet the whole forecast demand, observing the operating constraints of the refinery and minimizing the number of operational changes. A real-life data-set related to the production of fuel oil and asphalt in a large refinery was used. The MILP and GA models proved to be good solutions for both primary objectives, but the GA model resulted in a smaller number of operational changes. The reason for this is that GA incorporates a multi-criteria approach, which is capable of adaptively updating the weights of the objective throughout the evolutionary process. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

In particular, Decision Programming makes it possible to (i) solve problems in which earlier decisions cannot necessarily be recalled later, for instance, when decisions are taken by agents who cannot communicate with each other; (ii) accommodate a broad range of deterministic and chance constraints, including those based on resource consumption, logical dependencies or risk measures such as Conditional Value-at-Risk; and (iii) determine all non-dominated decision strategies in problems which involve multiple value objectives.

abstract = {Interest in sustainability has increased the share of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) in power generation. Energy storage systems' potential to mitigate intermittencies from non-dispatchable VRES has enhanced their appeal. However, the impacts of storage vary based on the owner and market conditions. We examine the policy implications of investments in utility-scale battery storage via a bi-level optimization model. The lower level depicts power system operations, modeled as either perfect competition or Cournot oligopoly to allow for the assessment of producer market power. The upper-level investor is either a welfare-maximizer or a profit-maximizing standalone merchant to reflect either welfare enhancement or arbitrage, respectively. We implement a realistic case study for Western Europe based on all possible size-location storage investment combinations. We find that market competition affects investment sizes, locations, and their profitability more than the investor's objectives. A welfare-maximizer under perfect competition invests the most in storage capacity. Consumers typically gain most from storage investments in all cases, exceeding the gains for the investors. Specifically, our results show that storage investments may either not occur or be located differently than at social optimum, if market power is exerted. Thus, policy makers need to anticipate producer market power when setting regulation.},
