  abstract = {Turbulence-enhanced mixing of upper ocean heat allows interaction between the tropical atmosphere and cold water masses that impact climate at higher latitudes thereby regulating air{\textendash}sea coupling and poleward heat transport. Tropical cyclones (TCs) can drastically enhance upper ocean mixing and generate powerful near-inertial internal waves (NIWs) that propagate down into the deep ocean. Globally, downward mixing of heat during TC passage causes warming in the seasonal thermocline and pumps 0.15 to 0.6 PW of heat into the unventilated ocean. The final distribution of excess heat contributed by TCs is needed to understand subsequent consequences for climate; however, it is not well constrained by current observations. Notably, whether or not excess heat supplied by TCs penetrates deep enough to be kept in the ocean beyond the winter season is a matter of debate. Here, we show that NIWs generated by TCs drive thermocline mixing weeks after TC passage and thus greatly deepen the extent of downward heat transfer induced by TCs. Microstructure measurements of the turbulent diffusivity ( {$\mathsl{K}$} {$\kappa$} ) and turbulent heat flux (J {$\mathsl{q}$} q ) in the Western Pacific before and after the passage of three TCs indicate that mean thermocline values of  {$\mathsl{K}$} {$\kappa$}  and J {$\mathsl{q}$} q  increased by factors of 2 to 7 and 2 to 4 (95\% confidence level), respectively, after TC passage. Excess mixing is shown to be associated with the vertical shear of NIWs, demonstrating that studies of TC{\textendash}climate interactions ought to represent NIWs and their mixing to accurately capture TC effects on background ocean stratification and climate.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Enhanced diapycnal mixing induced by the near-bottom breaking of internal waves is an essential component of the lower meridional overturning circulation. Despite its crucial role in the ocean circulation, tidally driven internal wave breaking is challenging to observe due to its inherently short spatial and temporal scales. We present detailed moored and shipboard observations that resolve the spatio-temporal variability of the tidal response over a small-scale bump embedded in the continental slope of Tasmania. Cross-shore tidal currents drive a nonlinear trapped response over the steep bottom around the bump. The observations are roughly consistent with two-dimensional high-mode tidal lee-wave theory. However, the alongshore tidal velocities are large, suggesting that the alongshore bathymetric variability modulates the tidal response driven by the cross-shore tidal flow. The semidiurnal tide and energy dissipation rate are correlated at subtidal timescales, but with complex temporal variability. Energy dissipation from a simple scattering model shows that the elevated near-bottom turbulence can be sustained by the impinging mode-1 internal tide, where the dissipation over the bump is               O               (1\%) of the incident depth-integrated energy flux. Despite this small fraction, tidal dissipation is enhanced over the bump due to steep topography at               O               (1) km horizontal scale and may locally drive significant diapycnal mixing.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The energy and momentum balance of an abyssal overflow across a major sill in the Samoan Passage is estimated from two highly resolved towed sections, set 16 months apart, and results from a two-dimensional numerical simulation. Driven by the density anomaly across the sill, the flow is relatively steady. The system gains energy from divergence of horizontal pressure work               O               (5) kWm               -1               and flux of available potential energy               O               (2) kWm               -1               . Approximately half of these gains are transferred into kinetic energy while the other half is lost to turbulent dissipation, bottom drag, and divergence in vertical pressure work. Small-scale internal waves emanating downstream of the sill within the overflow layer radiate               O               (1) kWm               -1               upwards but dissipate most of their energy within the dense overflow layer and at its upper interface. The strongly sheared and highly stratified upper interface acts as a critical layer inhibiting any appreciable upward radiation of energy via topographically generated lee waves. Form drag of               O               (2) Nm               -2               , estimated from the pressure drop across the sill, is consistent with energy lost to dissipation and internal wave fluxes. The topographic drag removes momentum from the mean flow, slowing it down and feeding a counter current aloft. The processes discussed in this study combine to convert about one third of the energy released from the cross-sill density difference into turbulent mixing within the overflow and at its upper interface. The observed and modeled vertical momentum flux divergence sustains gradients in shear and stratification, thereby maintaining an efficient route for abyssal water mass transformation downstream of this Samoan Passage sill.},

  abstract = {Abstract Tidal and low-frequency flows interact with abrupt topographic features, giving rise to a variety of small-scale phenomena including lee waves, vortical motions and turbulence. With the goal of identifying the processes that transfer momentum and energy between the larger-scale and smaller-scale flows, detailed tidally-resolving shipboard surveys were conducted near a sharp and steep headland north of Velasco Reef, Palau, in the Western Pacific. We present velocity, microstructure and rapid-cycling conductivity and temperature measurements, contextualized with a nearby 10-month moored record, to examine wake and vortex structures. Observed flow near Velasco Reef was layered and multi-directional in depth such that the ``downstream'' side of the headland depended on depth. Downstream of the headland, during a period where mean flow dominated over the tide in the top 100 m of the water column, turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates were enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude relative to those upstream. During a period dominated by tides, the flow reversed periodically and wake eddies were associated with turbulent dissipation rates up to . Turbulent dissipation rates in the wake increased with inverse Richardson number for both tidal and mean flows past the headland, and were larger for stronger vorticity flows. Our analysis suggests that the eddies themselves lead to shear instabilities and subsequent turbulence, either through tilting or their limited vertical extent. We associate the enhanced downstream dissipation with a combination of breaking internal tides and either these eddy processes or a multi-scaled turbulent wake.},
