```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)


  install.packages("RefManageR")
  #require(dplyr)
  install.packages("stringr")
  install.packages("anytime")

```

## Exploring
```{r cars}

bibfile <- "./publicationsER2.bib"
out_fold   <- "./"

bibtex_2academic(bibfile  = my_bibfile, 
                 outfold   = out_fold, 
                 abstract  = FALSE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
