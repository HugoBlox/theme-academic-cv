\begin{rSection}{Short Bio}
I’m a senior year undergraduate student at Australian National University(ANU) pursuing a bachelor's degree of Advanced Computing(honor), prior to joining the double degree program of ANU, I was studying computer science at Shandong University in China.

My current research is under the supervision of Professor Tom Gedeon at ANU on the topic of variational auto-encoder, I’m also doing some summarizing works with respect to the Bayesian network which is currently under review by my thesis co-supervisor. I have a 6.00/7.00 GPA and familiar with basic math tools e.g. variational inferences, probabilistic graphical models, convex optimization, etc.
