abstract = {The zebrafish Danio rerio is a powerful model system to study the genetics of development and disease. However, maintenance of zebrafish husbandry records is both time intensive and laborious, and a standardized way to manage and track the large amount of unique lines in a given laboratory or centralized facility has not been embraced by the field. Here we present FishNet, an intuitive, open source, relational database for managing data and information related to zebrafish husbandry and maintenance. By creating a virtual facility, FishNET enables users to remotely inspect the rooms, racks, tanks and lines within a given facility. Importantly, FishNET scales from one laboratory, to an entire facility with several laboratories, to multiple facilities, generating a cohesive laboratory and community-based platform. Automated data entry eliminates confusion regarding line nomenclature and streamlines maintenance of individual lines, while flexible query forms allow researchers to retrieve database records based on user-defined criteria. FishNet also links associated embryonic and adult biological samples with data, such as genotyping results or confocal images, to enable robust and efficient colony management and storage of laboratory information. A shared calendar function with email notifications and automated reminders for line turnover, automated tank counts and census reports promote communication with both end-users and administrators. The expected benefits of FishNET are improved vivaria efficiency, increased quality control for experimental numbers, and flexible data reporting and retrieval. FishNets easy, intuitive record management and open source, end user-modifiable architecture provides an efficient solution to real-time zebrafish colony management for users throughout a facility and institution, and in some cases across entire research hubs.},

abstract = {Here, we document a collection of ∼7434 MiMIC (Minos Mediated Integration Cassette) insertions of which 2854 are inserted in coding introns. They allowed us to create a library of 400 GFP-tagged genes. We show that 72{\%} of internally tagged proteins are functional, and that more than 90{\%} can be imaged in unfixed tissues. Moreover, the tagged mRNAs can be knocked down by RNAi against GFP (iGFPi), and the tagged proteins can be efficiently knocked down by deGradFP technology. The phenotypes associated with RNA and protein knockdown typically correspond to severe loss of function or null mutant phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate reversible, spatial, and temporal knockdown of tagged proteins in larvae and adult flies. This new strategy and collection of strains allows unprecedented in vivo manipulations in flies for many genes. These strategies will likely extend to vertebrates.In the last few decades, technical advances in altering the genes of organisms have led to many discoveries about how genes work. For example, it is now possible to add a specific DNA sequence to a gene so that the protein it makes will carry a ‘tag' that enables us to track it in cells. One such tag is called green fluorescent protein (GFP) and it is often used to study other proteins in living cells because it produces green fluorescence that can be detected under a microscope.It is labor intensive to add tags to individual genes, so this limits the number of proteins that can be studied in this way. In 2011, researchers developed a new method that can easily tag many genes in fruit flies. It makes use of small sections of DNA called transposons, which are able to move around the genome by ‘cutting' themselves out of one location and ‘pasting' themselves in somewhere else.The researchers used a transposon called Minos, which is naturally found in fruit flies. When Minos inserts into a gene, it often disrupts the gene and stops it from working. However, the researchers could swap the inserted transposon for a gene encoding GFP by making use of a natural process that rearranges DNA in cells. This resulted in the protein encoded by the gene containing GFP and so it can be detected under a microscope. This method allowed the researchers to create a collection of fly lines that have the GFP tag on many different proteins.Now, Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al. have greatly expanded this initial collection. More than 75{\%} of GFP-tagged proteins worked normally and the flies producing these altered proteins remain healthy. It is possible to use a technique called RNA interference against the GFP to lower the production of the tagged proteins. Moreover, Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al. show that it is also possible to degrade the tagged proteins so that less protein is present. The removal of proteins is reversible and can be done in specific tissues during any phase in fly development. These techniques allow researchers to directly associate the loss of the protein with the consequences for the fly.This collection of fruit fly lines is a useful resource that can help us understand how genes work. The method for tagging the proteins could also be modified to work in other animals.},

@article{Fish2017,
abstract = {The transcriptional pathways activated downstream of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling during angiogenesis remain incompletely characterized. By assessing the signals responsible for induction of the Notch ligand delta-like 4 (DLL4) in endothelial cells, we find that activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway mirrors the rapid and dynamic induction of DLL4 transcription and that this pathway is required for DLL4 expression. Furthermore, VEGF/ERK signaling induces phosphorylation and activation of the ETS transcription factor ERG, a prerequisite for DLL4 induction. Transcription of DLL4 coincides with dynamic ERG-dependent recruitment of the transcriptional co-activator p300. Genome-wide gene expression profiling identified a network of VEGF-responsive and ERG-dependent genes, and ERG chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq revealed the presence of conserved ERG-bound putative enhancer elements near these target genes. Functional experiments performed in vitro and in vivo confirm that this network of genes requires ERK, ERG and p300 activity. Finally, genome-editing and transgenic approaches demonstrate that a highly conserved ERG-bound enhancer located upstream of HLX (which encodes a transcription factor implicated in sprouting angiogenesis) is required for its VEGF-mediated induction. Collectively, these findings elucidate a novel transcriptional pathway contributing to VEGF-dependent angiogenesis.},
