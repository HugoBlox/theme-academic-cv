      <description>Grand Floridian Hotel Reviews: Sentiment Analysis and NLP The data for this analysis was obtained from the reviews posted on TripAdvisor. I used RSelenium and rvest to extract the data from the first 3000 dynamic web-pages on the TripAdvisor site, which was 2,350 reviews in total. The code used to do this is published on my GitHub. Here, I load the the Rda file I saved from that extraction.</description>

      <description>The data used for this analysis was originally published by Touring Plans.
I used the data for six rides: two from the Magic Kingdom (Seven Dwarfs Mine Train &amp;amp; Splash Mountain), two from Hollywood Studios (Toy Story Mania &amp;amp; The Rockin Rollercoaster), and two from Epcot (Soarin &amp;amp; Spaceship Earth).
library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) library(skimr) library(ModelMetrics) library(janitor) library(broom) library(forcats) library(kableExtra) library(stringr) There was a separate csv file for each ride. I originally merged &amp;amp; cleaned this data using Python, which can be found here.</description>
